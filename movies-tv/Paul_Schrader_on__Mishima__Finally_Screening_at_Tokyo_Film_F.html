  <p>In a striking revelation, Schrader said he believes audiences will pay to watch AI‑generated actors in the same way they pay for blockbuster stars. He argued that “the allure of cinema lies in the emotional connection to a character,” and that a well‑crafted AI can deliver that. He cited the screen presence of Brando and Kevin Costner as benchmarks: “If an AI can channel the gravitas of Brando or the charisma of Costner, people will line up for the experience.”</p>
