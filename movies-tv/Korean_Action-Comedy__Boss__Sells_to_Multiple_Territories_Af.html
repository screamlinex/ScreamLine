                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Korean sales powerhouse Finecut has closed multiple international deals for local hit “Boss,” the action-comedy that has pulled in over 2.3 million admissions in its home territory and ranks as the fifth highest‑grossing Korean film of 2025. The gang‑themed comedy has been snapped up by distributors across Asia and beyond, including Abnormal Studios for Cambodia, and a host of other regional players eager to tap into its box‑office momentum.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Finecut’s Strategic Moves</h4>
  <p>Finecut, known for turning domestic successes into global hits, leveraged its extensive network to secure rights for “Boss” across multiple territories. By aligning with regional distributors early in the release cycle, the company ensured that the film would reach audiences in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America before the domestic window closed.</p>
  <p>“We identified key markets where action‑comedy thrives, and ‘Boss’ fit the bill perfectly,” says Finecut’s Head of Global Sales, Ji‑woo Park. “Our strategy is to pair strong domestic performance with a coordinated international rollout that maximizes visibility and revenue.”</p>

In the Middle East, Al-Falak Media has taken on the film for the Arabic‑speaking audience, and in Latin America, Brazil’s Globo Filmes will handle the release.</p>
  <p>Each distributor plans a tailored marketing push, combining digital trailers, social media campaigns, and local celebrity endorsements to capture the film’s blend of humor and high‑octane action.</p>
