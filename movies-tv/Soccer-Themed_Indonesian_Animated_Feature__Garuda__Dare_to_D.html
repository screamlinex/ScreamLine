                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Indonesian producer Shanty Harmayn has taken the animated feature *Garuda: Dare to Dream* to the Tokyo Gap‑Financing Market, marking his studio’s first venture into animation. Set to launch in theaters in early 2026, the soccer‑themed story follows 13‑year‑old Putra, an asthma‑stricken dreamer who aspires to play for Indonesia’s national team. The pitch seeks to secure both financing and distribution partners to bring the film to a global audience.</p>

  <h4>Market Debut</h4>
  <p>In a bustling Tokyo venue that hosts some of the world’s most promising projects, Shanty Harmayn unveiled *Garuda: Dare to Dream* to a room full of investors, distributors, and media representatives. The gap‑financing market offers a unique platform where mid‑budget productions can attract the capital needed to finish post‑production work, secure international sales, and build a marketing campaign. Harmayn’s presentation highlighted the film’s potential to appeal not only to Southeast Asian audiences but also to the vast soccer‑enthusiast market worldwide.</p>

The film blends vibrant animation with authentic Indonesian culture, showcasing local festivals, traditional music, and the iconic Garuda emblem—symbolic of the nation’s spirit and aspirations.</p>

  <h4>Production & Vision</h4>
  <p>Produced by Harmayn’s studio, this project marks a strategic shift from live‑action to fully animated storytelling. Collaborating with seasoned animators from both Indonesia and Japan, the team aims to craft a visual style that balances realism with the expressive dynamism of anime. “We want *Garuda* to feel like a living, breathing dream,” Harmayn said, noting the film’s intention to inspire children across Asia to pursue their passions, no matter the obstacles.</p>

  <h4>Future Outlook</h4>
  <p>With the Tokyo pitch complete, the studio is actively courting distribution deals in Southeast Asia, China, and the United States. Early indications suggest strong interest from major streaming platforms looking to expand their sports and animation libraries. If the financing goal is met, production will move into the final stages of animation, targeting a premiere at the 2025 Busan International Film Festival before its theatrical debut in early 2026.</p>
