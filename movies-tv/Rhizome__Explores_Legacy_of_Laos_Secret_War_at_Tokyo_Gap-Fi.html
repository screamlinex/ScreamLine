                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> “Rhizome,” a feature film that probes the buried trauma of America’s “Secret War” in Laos, is now seeking co‑producers and sales agents at the Tokyo Gap‑Financing Market. Directed by Rotterdam‑award winner Jakrawal Nilthamrong and produced by Chatchai Chaiyon, the film follows Na, a Lao‑American caught between the past and present, as he confronts the ghosts of war that still haunt the Mekong Valley. Production is slated for 2026, and the project looks to secure the financial and distribution partners needed to bring this powerful story to an international audience.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Film Synopsis</h4>
  <p>“Rhizome” follows Na (played by rising Lao‑American star Ananta Phomphak), a young archaeologist who discovers a forgotten stash of unexploded ordnance in the hills of Luang Prabang. As she digs deeper, she unearths letters, photographs, and a diary that reveal the clandestine U.S. bombing campaign that devastated Laos during the 1960s and 1970s. The film weaves Na’s personal journey with flashbacks to the war’s atrocities, exploring themes of memory, identity, and the lingering impact of foreign intervention on local communities.</p>

  <h4>Director & Producer</h4>

Nilthamrong’s previous work has earned acclaim for its lyrical treatment of historical trauma and cultural displacement.</p>
  <p>Producer Chatchai Chaiyon, known for “Manta Ray,” is committed to elevating Southeast Asian stories on the global stage. His track record of securing international co‑production deals and navigating complex funding landscapes positions “Rhizome” for a successful launch.</p>
