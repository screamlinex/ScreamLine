                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> In a candid roundtable hosted by Variety on Oct. 26 in Los Angeles, production designer Yohei Taneda and producer Chieko Murata joined co‑editor‑in‑chief Cynthia Littleton to discuss the Japanese drama “Kokuho.” The conversation unpacked how the film blends traditional Kabuki theater with contemporary storytelling, focusing on the lives of two actors and the broader art of performance.</p>

  <h4>Producer Perspective: Chieko Murata on Bringing the Drama to the Screen</h4>
  <p>Murata opened the discussion by outlining her mission: “Kabuki offers a unique lens into Japanese culture, but it can feel distant to modern viewers.” She recounted how the production team used a dual narrative—one following the seasoned Kabuki master, the other a rising star—to illustrate the generational bridge. “The drama is a love letter to art, to the actors, and to the life they live,” she said.</p>
