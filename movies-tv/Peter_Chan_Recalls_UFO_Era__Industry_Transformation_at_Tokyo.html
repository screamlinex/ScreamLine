                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Peter Chan Ho‑sun, once a force of the UFO (United Filmmakers Organization) era that flooded Tokyo’s cinemas in the early 1990s, returns to the city’s International Film Festival after nearly thirty years. In a candid interview, the Hong Kong‑born director reflects on how market dynamics shaped his journey from Hong Kong’s golden age, through Hollywood ventures, to his current work in mainland China. Chan shares insights on adapting to changing audiences, the evolution of Chinese cinema, and his philosophy of making “movies that the market needs.”</p>

  <h4>Homecoming to Tokyo: A Milestone Reunion</h4>
  <p>Standing amid the bustling festival grounds, Chan was visibly moved by the familiar glow of Tokyo’s film screens—once his UFO productions had lit up every theater in the city. He recalled the excitement of the 1993 festival, where his film “The Sky is No Limit” won a special jury prize, and how that moment set the stage for his international aspirations. “It’s like coming back to a childhood home,” Chan mused, noting the city’s role in his early career.</p>

  <h4>UFO Era Legacy: Innovation Meets Audience</h4>
  <p>The UFO collective, known for its bold storytelling and experimental visuals, challenged the mainstream Hong Kong cinema of its time. Chan credits the group’s emphasis on commercial viability and creative risk-taking for teaching him how to balance artistic integrity with box‑office demands. He highlights how the UFO era’s success in Japan, especially with the 1994 hit “Midnight Storm,” demonstrated that local stories could resonate globally when packaged for the market.</p>

  <h4>From Hong Kong to Hollywood to Mainland China: A Market‑Driven Journey</h4>
  <p>After the UFO years, Chan ventured to Hollywood, directing the 1998 sci‑fi thriller “Nebula’s Edge.” While the film underperformed domestically, it opened doors in the U.S. market and taught him the importance of audience research and genre trends. Returning to China in the early 2000s, he pivoted to high‑budget action dramas that capitalized on the country’s booming film industry. “I’ve always listened to the market’s heartbeat,” he says, noting that understanding cultural shifts has become essential for any director seeking global reach.</p>

  <h4>Looking Ahead: Crafting Movies That the Market Needs</h4>
  <p>Today, Chan is working on a biopic about a legendary Chinese martial artist, combining historical accuracy with blockbuster spectacle. He stresses the need for “authentic storytelling that also delivers on entertainment.” In a world where streaming platforms dominate, Chan believes that filmmakers must adapt quickly, tailoring content to diverse platforms while preserving a distinct cultural voice. He concludes that the key to longevity lies in being both a storyteller and a savvy market analyst.</p>
