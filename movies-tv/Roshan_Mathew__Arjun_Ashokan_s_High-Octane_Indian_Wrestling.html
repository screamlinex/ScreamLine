<h4>Teaser Highlights</h4>
<p>The opening shots plunge viewers straight into a bustling street market in Kochi, where an underground wrestling ring is set up beneath a dilapidated sari shop. Roshan Mathew’s character, an ambitious local champion named Kannan, throws punches at an imposing rival, while Arjun Ashokan’s gritty antihero, Vikas, watches from the sidelines, eyes gleaming with a mixture of respect and rivalry.</p>
<p>The teaser is peppered with high‑octane fight choreography, intercut with close‑up shots of wrestlers’ battered faces and the rhythmic thud of gloves against canvas. A dramatic montage of the crew’s relentless training sessions, the roar of the crowd, and the clang of steel ropes sets an electrifying tone, promising a film that blends raw athleticism with a sharp, comedic edge.</p>
