                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Tokyo International Film Festival’s programming director Ichiyama Shozo has been curating films since the 1990s, navigating the seismic shift from 35 mm to digital while maintaining his core philosophy remains unchanged. “Cinematic expression has hardly changed at all just because it has become digital,” Ichiyama tells Variety. “Therefore, I believe that fundamentally nothing has changed in the way stories are told.” He continues to champion diversity, discovery, and the relentless pursuit of new voices on the global cinema stage.</p>

  <h4>Legacy and Early Career</h4>
  <p>When Ichiyama first joined the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1992, the world of cinema was still dominated by celluloid. He quickly earned a reputation for spotting unconventional talent and pairing bold storytelling with meticulous craftsmanship. Over the next decade, he curated retrospectives that celebrated classic auteurs while simultaneously elevating up‑and‑coming filmmakers from the periphery of Japan’s film scene.</p>
  <p>His early work set a precedent: a festival that honored the past but was always looking forward. “I’ve always believed that a festival’s job is to be a bridge, not a gatekeeper,” he says, a principle that guided his selection process even as the medium began to evolve.</p>

  <h4>Digital Transition</h4>
  <p>The transition from 35 mm to digital was a turning point for the festival, and for Ichiyama personally. In a candid interview with Variety, he notes, “The technology changed, but the core of cinema—story, emotion, the human condition—remains the same.” He explains how digital workflows have streamlined production, allowed for more experimental formats, and opened the door for indie filmmakers with limited budgets.</p>
  <p>Despite these advancements, Ichiyama remains cautious about the homogenizing potential of digital platforms. “We must preserve the tactile experience of film; otherwise we risk losing the intimacy that only a physical medium can provide.” He has therefore championed hybrid festivals that showcase both high‑definition digital releases and traditional 35 mm screenings.</p>

  <h4>Diversity & Inclusion</h4>
  <p>In recent years, Ichiyama has made a concerted effort to broaden the festival’s cultural and gender representation. He introduced a “Women in Film” series, spotlighting female directors from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and created an initiative that pairs emerging filmmakers with established mentors.</p>
  <p>“Cinema is a mirror of society,” he says. “If we’re not reflecting the multiplicity of voices, we’re failing our audiences.” His initiatives have earned him recognition from international film bodies for promoting equitable representation in the cinematic arts.</p>

  <h4>Future Vision</h4>
  <p>Looking ahead, Ichiyama envisions a festival that is both a guardian of tradition and a catalyst for innovation. He plans to expand the digital platform to include immersive storytelling experiences, such as virtual‑reality screenings and interactive panel discussions.</p>
  <p>He remains committed to the festival’s founding credo: “Cinematic expression has hardly changed at all just because it has become digital.” With this mindset, Tokyo International Film Festival is poised to remain a vital cultural hub, continually discovering new talent while honoring the timeless essence of film.</p>
