                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Ben Stiller recently took to the Howard Stern Show to discuss the rising term “nepo baby” – a label for children of celebrity parents who launch their own careers. In a candid interview, Stiller argued that the label can actually serve as a selling point, likening it to the brand power of the Brat Pack. He also reflected on his own legacy, noting how his documentary “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” celebrates the influence of his parents, actor Paul Stiller and director/producer Nancy Meara, while embracing the complexities of fame inherited by the next generation.</p>

  <h4>The Howard Stern Show</h4>
  <p>When the iconic talk show host called Stiller in, the conversation quickly veered from his latest film projects to the cultural buzz around “nepo babies.” Stern’s trademark probing style forced Stiller to explain why he thinks the term, often used pejoratively, can be a marketing asset rather than a stigma.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Ben Stiller’s Perspective</h4>
  <p>Stiller admits that growing up in Hollywood’s spotlight gave him both privileges and pressures. He says that by owning the label, he can control the narrative and turn it into a unique angle for his brand. “If you’re born into a family that people already know, the name is a hook,” he told Stern. “It’s not a curse; it’s a conversation starter.”</p>
  <p>He also referenced his documentary, where he chronicled his parents’ careers, framing it as an homage to the very industry that shapes “nepo babies.” The film, released earlier this year, showcases their artistic journey and offers Stiller a personal lens on the cycle of fame.</p>

  <h4>The Nepo Baby Narrative</h4>
  <p>“Nepo baby” has become shorthand for the perceived unfair advantage of celebrity offspring. Critics argue it perpetuates inequality, while proponents claim it reflects the reality of mentorship and opportunity. Stiller acknowledges both sides, noting that the term can either pigeonhole a performer or amplify their reach, depending on how it’s leveraged.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>The Brat Pack Connection</h4>
  <p>Stiller compared the current trend to the 1980s Brat Pack, a group of young actors who gained notoriety together. He said, “It’s almost like we’re talking about a brand now – like a badge of belonging.” By invoking the Brat Pack, he frames “nepo babies” not as a flaw but as a recognizable, marketable identity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Industry Implications</h4>
  <p>Stiller’s stance could influence how studios approach casting decisions and marketing strategies. If the label is embraced, it might open doors for more collaborative projects that highlight family legacies. On the flip side, the debate may prompt a deeper conversation about talent, merit, and accessibility in Hollywood.</p>
