                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> In a candid exchange at the Tokyo International Film Festival’s TIFF Lounge, Cambodian filmmaker Rithy Panh and Japanese director Miyake Sho explored the intersections of cinema, memory, and labor. Panh, who presided over the Locarno jury that awarded Miyake’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” spoke in French, while Miyake shared insights on the evolving habits of contemporary viewers. The discussion highlighted how both filmmakers view cinema as a vehicle for remembrance and a reflection of everyday toil, offering audiences a fresh perspective on the art form’s cultural resonance.</p>

<h4>Opening Remarks: A Cross‑Cultural Convergence</h4>
<p>The session kicked off with a warm welcome from the festival’s organizers, followed by a brief introduction of the two guests.

<h4>Memory and the Language of Film</h4>
<p>Panh drew parallels between his own work and the collective memory of Cambodia, arguing that cinema is “the last place where we can witness history in motion.” He cited his film “The White Silk” as an example of how visual storytelling preserves personal and national trauma. Miyake echoed this sentiment, noting that his film “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” captures the fleeting nature of human connection, a theme that resonates universally. The duo discussed how both of their films rely on subtle cues—sound, silence, and mise‑en‑scène—to evoke memory without explicit narration.</p>

<h4>Labor in the Film Industry: A Global Perspective</h4>
<p>Turning to the topic of labor, Panh described the harsh realities of filmmaking in post‑war Cambodia, where limited resources force crews to improvise and collaborate across borders. He highlighted the importance of community support, citing the collective effort that went into producing “The Last Reel.” Miyake, meanwhile, reflected on the gig economy within Japan’s film sector, stressing the need for flexible work arrangements for crew members who juggle multiple projects. Both filmmakers stressed that a fair, respectful approach to labor not only ensures artistic integrity but also protects the well‑being of everyone involved.</p>

<h4>Changing Viewing Habits and the Future of Cinema</h4>
<p>The conversation concluded with a discussion on how audiences today consume film. Panh noted the rise of streaming platforms, but emphasized that physical screenings still carry an emotional weight that digital formats cannot replicate. Miyake shared his experience with online premieres, suggesting that hybrid distribution models could democratize access while preserving the communal experience of a cinema seat. The panelists agreed that future filmmakers must adapt to these evolving habits without compromising the essence of storytelling.</p>
