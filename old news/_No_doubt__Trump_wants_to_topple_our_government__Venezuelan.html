                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Venezuela’s Attorney General has accused former U.S. President Donald Trump of planning to topple the Venezuelan government, alleging that the United States intends to transform the nation into a “colonial” entity. The claims emerged during a BBC interview where the attorney general outlined a purported U.S. strategy to destabilize the country and install a pro‑American regime.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Venezuelan Attorney General’s Bold Accusation</h4>
  <p>In a rare public statement, Venezuela’s Attorney General, María Fernanda González, told the BBC that the U.S. has a covert agenda to turn the South American nation into a “colony.” She cited intelligence reports suggesting that the U.S. is coordinating with opposition groups to undermine President Nicolás Maduro’s administration.</p>
  <p>González described the alleged plan as “a deliberate attempt to sow chaos and weaken Venezuela’s sovereignty,” warning that such actions could lead to a prolonged civil conflict and loss of national autonomy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Trump’s Alleged Role in the Coup Plot</h4>
  <p>According to the attorney general, former President Trump’s political network has been actively involved in facilitating the coup. She pointed to private communications between Trump’s advisers and Venezuelan dissidents, arguing that these exchanges reveal a direct interest in toppling Maduro.</p>
  <p>While Trump has denied any involvement, the allegations have intensified scrutiny on his former administration’s foreign policy and its potential impact on Venezuela’s political stability.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>International Reactions and U.S. Response</h4>
  <p>The United Nations and several European nations have called for an independent investigation into the claims, stressing the need for transparency and respect for Venezuela’s democratic processes.</p>
  <p>The U.S. State Department, however, has issued a statement dismissing the allegations as “unsubstantiated political rhetoric,” asserting that the United States remains committed to supporting democratic dialogue in Venezuela.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Road Ahead for Venezuelan Politics</h4>
  <p>Experts warn that if the accusations gain traction, they could further polarize an already fragmented political landscape. The Venezuelan opposition has vowed to continue its push for reforms, while Maduro’s allies maintain that the government is under external threat.</p>
  <p>As the international community watches closely, the situation underscores the fragile balance between domestic governance and foreign influence in Venezuela’s ongoing struggle for stability.</p>
