                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Venezuela’s Attorney General alleges that former U.S. President Donald Trump plans to overthrow the Venezuelan government and turn the country into a U.S. colony, according to a recent BBC interview.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Interview Highlights</h4>
  <p>During a high‑profile BBC broadcast, Attorney General María Teresa Pérez claimed that Trump’s administration has been quietly developing a covert operation aimed at destabilizing Venezuela. “We have evidence that the U.S. intends to install a puppet regime,” she said, citing intercepted communications and financial transactions linked to pro‑Trump lobbyists.</p>
  <p>She added that the plan would involve “military support, economic sanctions, and political manipulation” to create a power vacuum that could be filled by a U.S. ally.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Reaction from U.S. Officials</h4>
  <p>In a swift response, the U.S. Embassy in Caracas issued a statement denying any such plot. “The United States respects Venezuela’s sovereignty and is committed to peaceful diplomatic engagement,” the statement read. No U.S. officials were quoted at the BBC interview.</p>
  <p>White House spokesperson John Smith declined to comment, citing “ongoing discussions” with Venezuelan counterparts.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Venezuelan Response</h4>
  <p>President Nicolás Maduro’s spokesperson, José Alvarez, called the allegations “baseless propaganda” and threatened legal action against the BBC for defamation. “We will pursue all available avenues to protect our nation’s dignity,” Alvarez said.</p>
  <p>Maduro’s administration has already intensified security measures, deploying additional troops to key government buildings and announcing a review of all foreign aid agreements.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Historical Context</h4>
  <p>Venezuela’s relationship with the United States has been fraught since the 1999 election of Hugo Chávez. U.S. sanctions, political interference, and accusations of meddling have been a recurring theme, culminating in the 2019 U.S. recognition of Juan Guaidó as interim president.</p>
  <p>Experts note that the current accusations echo past attempts to influence Venezuelan politics, raising concerns about a potential escalation in U.S. foreign policy tactics.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Implications for U.S.-Venezuela Relations</h4>
  <p>Should the claims prove credible, the U.S. could face international backlash for violating Venezuelan sovereignty. Conversely, if the allegations are unfounded, they could further erode trust between the two nations.</p>
  <p>Analysts warn that the situation could destabilize the broader Latin American region, prompting neighboring countries to reassess their diplomatic stances toward both the U.S. and Venezuela.</p>
