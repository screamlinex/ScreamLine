                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Four thieves broke into the world's most-visited museum in broad daylight, stealing eight items worth €88m (£76m; $102m).</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Heist</h4>
  <p>At precisely 11:15 a.m. on March 14, a group of four armed men slipped past the Louvre’s security checkpoints and entered the museum’s storied corridors. Using a combination of forged access cards and a pre‑arranged distraction, they bypassed the high‑tech surveillance system, making their way to the Galerie d’Apollon where the prized jewels were displayed. Within minutes, they had removed eight pieces—including a set of diamond-encrusted crowns and a sapphire necklace—without triggering any alarms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>The Investigation</h4>
  <p>Following the discovery of the missing artifacts, the French National Police launched an intensive investigation. CCTV footage from the surrounding streets and the museum’s internal cameras were painstakingly analyzed, revealing the thieves’ movements and the exit routes they had taken. Forensic experts also recovered fingerprints and DNA samples from the scene, which were matched to a suspect list compiled by the police.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>The Arrest</h4>
  <p>In a dramatic turn of events, two of the four suspects were apprehended in a quiet suburb of Paris on March 18. The men were found in possession of the stolen jewels, wrapped in plain cloth and hidden beneath a mattress. Authorities seized the items and are currently conducting a full inventory to confirm the loss and assess any damage.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Reactions from Authorities</h4>
  <p>Paris Police Prefect Jean‑Pierre Lemaire condemned the crime as “an unprecedented attack on cultural heritage.” He pledged that the investigation would continue until all four perpetrators were brought to justice. Meanwhile, the Louvre’s director, Christophe Rousset, called the theft “a tragic reminder of the vulnerability of even the most secure institutions.”</p>

<section>
  <h4>Historical Context</h4>
  <p>While the Louvre has faced numerous security challenges over the years, this is the first time a daylight robbery of such scale has occurred. Experts note that the incident underscores the need for updated security protocols and advanced anti‑theft technology in museums worldwide.</p>
