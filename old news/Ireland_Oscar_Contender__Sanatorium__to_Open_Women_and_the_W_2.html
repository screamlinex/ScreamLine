  <h4>“Sanatorium”: A Dark, Intimate Portrait of Isolation</h4>
  <p>Set in a remote, wind‑swept Irish manor, “Sanatorium” follows the story of a grieving mother, played by the formidable Fiona Shaw, who retreats to a secluded sanatorium to escape the trauma of her son’s disappearance. The film’s stark cinematography and haunting score create an atmosphere of claustrophobia, while the narrative explores themes of memory, grief, and the fragile line between sanity and madness. Critics have praised the film for its atmospheric tension and the nuanced performances of its ensemble cast.</p>
