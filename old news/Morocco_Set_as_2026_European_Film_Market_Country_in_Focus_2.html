                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Morocco has been chosen as the country in focus for the 2026 European Film Market (EFM), running February 12‑18 in conjunction with the 76th Berlin International Film Festival. The selection highlights Morocco’s vibrant cinematic heritage, its roster of internationally acclaimed filmmakers, and a thriving creative community that serves as a dynamic bridge between Africa, Europe, and the wider world.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Why Morocco? A Strategic Spotlight</h4>
  <p>The European Film Market is the world’s premier platform for film professionals to discover new projects, secure financing, and forge distribution deals. By designating Morocco as the country in focus, the organizers recognize the nation’s growing influence in global cinema and its strategic geographic position. Moroccan film productions have long been a conduit for cross‑cultural storytelling, and the country’s robust infrastructure— from state‑of‑the‑art studios in Rabat to the iconic desert landscapes of Ouarzazate—offers a unique blend of authenticity and versatility that attracts international co‑productions.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Cinematic Heritage Meets Modern Innovation</h4>
  <p>Morocco’s film history dates back to the early 20th century, with the establishment of the first Moroccan cinema in Casablanca and the rise of the “Moroccan New Wave” in the 1970s. Today, the industry has evolved into a sophisticated ecosystem that supports everything from independent art‑house films to high‑budget blockbusters. The country’s film schools—such as the Institut Supérieur de l’Image—produce a steady stream of talent, while the annual Marrakech International Film Festival continues to showcase regional and international voices. This blend of heritage and innovation positions Morocco as a fertile ground for fresh narratives that resonate across continents.</p>

  <h4>Key Filmmakers and Flagship Projects</h4>
  <p>Moroccan cinema boasts a roster of filmmakers whose work has garnered critical acclaim on the global stage. Directors like Nabil Ayouch, known for the Academy Award‑shortlisted “Much Loved,” and Moumen Smihi, whose contemplative dramas explore social dynamics, are frequently sought after for co‑production opportunities. Upcoming projects such as “The Desert’s Whisper” (a joint French‑Moroccan feature set in the Sahara) and “Neon Marrakech” (an urban thriller starring a mix of local and international talent) are slated for pre‑production during the EFM, offering potential partners a chance to engage early in the development process.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Opportunities for International Collaboration</h4>
  <p>EFM’s country‑in‑focus program is designed to facilitate networking, funding, and distribution for filmmakers from the spotlighted nation. For Morocco, this means increased visibility for its film industry, access to European co‑production funds, and the potential for wider theatrical releases. The market will host a dedicated “Moroccan Film Showcase” featuring trailers, press kits, and Q&A sessions with directors and producers, giving European buyers a firsthand look at the country’s creative output. Additionally, the EFM’s partnership with the Moroccan Ministry of Culture and the Moroccan Film Center will streamline the licensing process for foreign distributors interested in Moroccan titles.</p>
