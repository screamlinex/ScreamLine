                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Indian National Film Award‑winning actress Parvathy Thiruvothu is set to lead Don Palathara’s next directorial venture, sharing the screen with the acclaimed filmmaker‑actor Dileesh Pothan. Following her Oscar‑level performance in “Take Off” (2017) and a best actor nod at the International Film Festival of India, Parvathy brings a stellar track record and a powerful presence to the project, promising a fresh, emotionally charged narrative that blends drama with social commentary.</p>

  <h4>Project Overview</h4>
  <p>Don Palathara, best known for his gritty, character‑driven storytelling, has announced a new film that promises to push the envelope of Malayalam cinema.

  <h4>Dileesh Pothan’s Dual Contribution</h4>
  <p>While Dileesh Pothan is primarily known as a director, he will also make a cameo as a pivotal supporting character. Pothan’s involvement is expected to bring a layer of meta‑cinematic insight, as he has often explored the interplay between art and life in his own films. The actor’s presence is likely to attract his loyal fan base and add a layer of credibility to the project.</p>
