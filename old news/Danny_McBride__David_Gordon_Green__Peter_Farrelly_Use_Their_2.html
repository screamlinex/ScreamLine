                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Gabe Polsky’s latest documentary, “The Man Who Saves the World?”, chronicles the life of 75‑year‑old peace activist Patrick McCollum. After major streaming platforms shrugged at the film’s unconventional angle, Polsky turned to a trio of Hollywood heavyweights—Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, and Peter Farrelly—whose support and star power finally gave the project the visibility it needed.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Pitch That Puzzled the Streamers</h4>
  <p>Polsky’s initial attempts to secure a streaming deal were met with polite rejection. “I made a sizzle reel and took it to all the usual suspects,” he says. “For them, it felt like it was just too far out.” The documentary’s blend of quirky activism, intimate interviews, and a non‑linear narrative structure left many executives uncertain about its mass appeal.</p>

  <h4>Meet Patrick McCollum, the 75‑Year‑Old Peace Activist</h4>
  <p>McCollum’s life reads like a living scrapbook of protest: from the civil rights marches of the 1960s to his more recent anti‑war rallies in the 2020s, he’s a living testament to a decades‑long commitment to nonviolence. The film follows him through his modest home, his community gatherings, and his impromptu speeches that still attract a small, but devoted, following.</p>

  <h4>Star‑Studded Support</h4>
  <p>When Polsky reached out to Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, and Peter Farrelly, each responded enthusiastically. McBride, known for his sharp comedic timing, serves as a narrator, injecting humor into McCollum’s often serious monologues. Green directs several of the film’s more experimental segments, while Farrelly lends his signature feel‑good storytelling to the final montage that ties the documentary’s themes together.</p>

  <h4>What the Documentary Reveals</h4>

Through archival footage, expert commentary, and McCollum’s own reflections, “The Man Who Saves the World?” questions the efficacy of traditional protest methods and explores how individual conviction can ripple into global change.</p>
