                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Hurricane Melissa, a rare Category 5 storm, is intensifying as it heads toward Jamaica, with forecasts predicting landfall by Tuesday. The powerful cyclone has already claimed two lives in Haiti, raising concerns about widespread devastation across the Caribbean.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Storm Overview</h4>
  <p>Melissa has rapidly deepened over the western Caribbean, dropping its central pressure to a record‑low 920 mb and reaching sustained winds of 155 mph. The National Hurricane Center now classifies it as a Category 5 system, the strongest in the basin since 2017.</p>
  <p>Satellite imagery shows a well‑defined eye only 8 mi in diameter, surrounded by a wall of towering thunderstorms that have produced wind gusts exceeding 200 mph in the outer bands.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Impact in Haiti</h4>
  <p>Two residents were killed when a building collapsed in Port-au-Prince as the storm made landfall in the northern part of the country. Early reports indicate that the hurricane has already caused widespread flooding, with several villages cut off by swollen rivers.</p>
  <p>Haitian authorities have deployed emergency teams and set up temporary shelters, but limited resources and damaged infrastructure hamper relief efforts.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Jamaica Preparations</h4>
  <p>Jamaican officials have declared a state of emergency in the north‑east and are coordinating evacuations for low‑lying coastal communities. The Jamaica Meteorological Service has issued a Category 5 warning for the entire island, urging residents to secure property and avoid travel.</p>
  <p>Local ports have been closed, and the military has been mobilized to assist with debris removal and to maintain critical infrastructure once the storm passes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>International Response</h4>
  <p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has requested additional funding to support both Haiti and Jamaica. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) are preparing rapid response teams that could arrive within 48 hours of landfall.</p>
  <p>Neighboring countries, including Cuba and the Dominican Republic, have pledged to provide logistical support and medical assistance if needed.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Forecast and Future Outlook</h4>
  <p>Models predict that Melissa will maintain Category 5 intensity as it crosses Jamaica, potentially weakening over the Atlantic due to cooler waters and increased wind shear. However, the storm’s forward speed is expected to slow, allowing for an extended period of high winds and heavy rainfall.</p>
  <p>Officials urge residents to stay alert for updates, as the storm’s path could shift slightly based on atmospheric steering currents.</p>
