                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Authorities have issued a rare red wind warning, the highest alert level, for the capital Wellington.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Red Wind Warning Details</h4>
  <p>The New Zealand MetService has activated a red wind warning for Wellington and the surrounding Hawke’s Bay region after sustained gusts exceeded 120 km/h. This is the first time the highest alert level has been triggered since the system’s launch in 2008, indicating that wind speeds could reach or surpass 150 km/h in localized spots.</p>
  <p>Storm‑trooper officials advised residents to secure loose items, avoid high‑rise buildings, and stay indoors until the warning is lifted. The warning remains in effect until 9 pm local time, with meteorologists monitoring for a potential downgrade.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Power Outages and Impact</h4>
  <p>Power companies report that roughly 32,000 households and businesses have lost electricity, with the majority concentrated in the Wellington CBD, Miramar, and parts of the Kapiti Coast. Transmission lines have snapped, and emergency crews are working 24/7 to restore service.</p>
  <p>In addition to power loss, several traffic lights have failed, leading to congestion on State Highway 1 and the Wellington Harbour Bridge. Local schools have postponed opening times, and the Wellington Convention Centre has cancelled all events scheduled for the weekend.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Safety Advice and Community Response</h4>
  <p>The Ministry of Civil Defence urges residents to keep emergency kits ready, including batteries, flashlights, bottled water, and non-perishable food. They also recommend staying away from windows and using sturdy, wind‑resistant structures for shelter.</p>
  <p>Community groups have mobilised volunteers to distribute blankets, food, and hot drinks to those stranded in parks and public spaces. The Wellington City Council has set up a temporary information hub at the Civic Plaza to provide real‑time updates and support.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Entertainment Industry Disruptions</h4>
  <p>The sudden loss of power has thrown a wrench into several film shoots in the Wellington region, including the final scenes of a major blockbuster currently in post‑production. Production companies have halted work and are assessing the damage to set pieces and equipment.</p>
  <p>Local broadcasters are experiencing interruptions in live feeds, and the Wellington Film Festival’s opening gala has been postponed. Organisers are exploring backup generators and alternative venues to keep the festival on track.</p>
