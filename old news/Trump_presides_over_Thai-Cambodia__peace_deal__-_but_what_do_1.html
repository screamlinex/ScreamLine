<section>
  <h4>The Diplomatic Showdown</h4>
  <p>In a whirlwind event that felt straight out of a political thriller, former President Donald Trump stepped onto the stage in Bangkok to preside over a new Thai‑Cambodian “peace deal.” The deal, signed earlier this week, aims to resolve longstanding border disputes and restore economic ties that have been frayed by decades of tension.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Trump's Grand Entrance</h4>
  <p>Trump, who has long been a polarizing figure in Southeast Asia, delivered a rousing speech that he framed as a “historic moment” for both nations. He praised the “tremendous progress” made and urged both sides to “keep moving forward.” While his rhetoric was loud and confident, critics say his presence may have tipped the balance more toward a spectacle than substantive progress.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Thai and Cambodian Perspectives</h4>
  <p>Thai officials, on the other hand, were more cautious, describing the agreement as “a pathway to peace” rather than a definitive resolution. Cambodian leaders echoed the sentiment, stressing that the deal is a first step that will require ongoing dialogue and verification. Both governments emphasized the need for a clear implementation framework to avoid future disputes.</p>

<section>
  <h4>What It Means for the Region</h4>
  <p>If the agreement holds, it could unlock trade corridors, boost tourism, and ease cross‑border security concerns. However, skeptics warn that without robust enforcement mechanisms, the pact might unravel just as quickly as it was forged. The international community, particularly the ASEAN bloc, will be watching closely to see whether this diplomatic drama translates into lasting peace.</p>
