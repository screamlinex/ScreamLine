                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has condemned Israel’s latest parliamentary move to annex parts of the West Bank, warning that it would derail Washington’s strategy to secure a lasting ceasefire in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed Rubio’s concerns, stating the annexation would undermine the U.S. effort to broker a comprehensive peace settlement and could spark renewed violence in the region.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Rubio’s Warning</h4>
  <p>During a press briefing on Tuesday, Senator Marco Rubio called the Israeli parliament’s annexation bill “a dangerous step that threatens the stability of the entire region.” He urged the Biden administration to take a firm stand, emphasizing that any unilateral move would “undermine the U.S.’s credibility as a mediator” and could “ignite a new wave of conflict.” Rubio also warned that annexation would likely provoke international condemnation and could lead to economic sanctions against Israel.</p>

  <h4>Blinken’s Response</h4>
  <p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the U.N. headquarters, described the annexation proposal as “unacceptable” and a direct threat to the U.S. goal of ending the Gaza war. Blinken said the U.S. would “concentrate on a diplomatic solution that respects the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians” and would “use all available tools” to pressure Israel to abandon the plan. He also highlighted the potential for the move to derail ongoing ceasefire negotiations.</p>

  <h4>Israel’s Parliamentary Move</h4>
  <p>Israel’s Knesset passed a controversial bill on Monday that would allow the government to annex up to 10% of the West Bank, including key settlement blocs and parts of the Jordan Valley. The legislation, which has faced stiff opposition from the opposition and several international actors, is seen by critics as a step toward a two‑state solution that eliminates the possibility of a viable Palestinian state. Supporters argue the annexation would secure Israeli sovereignty over strategic areas.</p>

<section>
  <h4>International Community</h4>
  <p>European Union officials have condemned the bill, calling it a violation of international law and a setback for peace. The United Nations has called for an immediate halt to the annexation plans, while Arab League leaders have demanded a halt to the settlement expansion. Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers have expressed skepticism about the impact of the annexation on the broader conflict, suggesting that other factors—such as Gaza’s humanitarian crisis—are more immediate concerns.</p>
