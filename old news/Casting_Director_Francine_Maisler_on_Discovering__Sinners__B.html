                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Casting director Francine Maisler is the secret engine behind some of the most dynamic performances in contemporary cinema. With a finger on the pulse of talent, she’s recently shaped the breakout role of Miles Caton in “Sinners,” guided Matthew Pellicano into the young Springsteen of “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” and is already pulling the strings on the upcoming “Ella McCay.” Working on multiple projects simultaneously, Maisler balances the demands of high‑profile directors like Aaron Sorkin, Scott Cooper, and Denis Villeneuve, proving that a great cast is the backbone of a great film.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Crafting Authentic Characters</h4>
  <p>Maisler’s approach starts with the script. “I read the character’s arc, not just the lines,” she says. “The goal is to find someone who can inhabit the emotional truth of the role from the first page.” This method has earned her a reputation for discovering fresh talent that feels like a natural fit, whether it’s a seasoned actor or a newcomer stepping into the spotlight.</p>

  <h4>“Sinners” and Miles Caton’s Breakout</h4>
  <p>In “Sinners,” Maisler spotted a raw, understated energy in 19‑year‑old Miles Caton. “He was doing an audition for a different film,” she recalls. “But the way he carried himself, the subtle vulnerability in his eyes, it was exactly what the director was looking for.” Caton’s performance has already sparked critical acclaim, and Maisler credits her ability to read a character’s potential as the key to the film’s success.</p>

  <h4>Matthew Pellicano as Young Springsteen</h4>
  <p>When the team behind “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” needed a young version of the iconic rocker, they turned to Maisler’s network. Pellicano was chosen for his “electric presence” and his uncanny ability to mirror the original’s charisma. “He brought a genuine love for the music,” Maisler notes. “That authenticity translated into a performance that felt both fresh and true to the legend.”</p>

  <h4>Upcoming Projects: “Ella McCay” and Beyond</h4>
  <p>Maisler is already in the trenches for “Ella McCay,” a biopic that promises to be a character study of resilience. “The director wants a lead who can carry the weight of a complex story,” she explains. “That’s why I’m looking for actors who can blend vulnerability with strength.” Her eye for talent will be pivotal as the film moves from pre‑production to the set.</p>

  <h4>Balancing a Full Slate of Projects</h4>
  <p>With Sorkin, Cooper, and Villeneuve on her roster, Maisler keeps a tight schedule. “I’m juggling callbacks, screen tests, and on‑set support for several films at once,” she admits. “It’s exhausting, but the thrill of discovering the next big star keeps me going.” Her ability to maintain quality across multiple projects has made her a sought‑after name in Hollywood’s casting scene.</p>
