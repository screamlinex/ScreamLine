                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Kurdish counter‑terrorism officials report that Islamic State cells in Syria are regrouping and increasing attacks, prompting a closer look inside the prison that holds key suspects.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Prison</h4>
  <p>Located on the outskirts of Raqqa, the facility has been expanded over the past year to house more than 200 IS detainees. The complex now includes a new high‑security wing designed to prevent escape and block communication with the outside world.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>The Suspects</h4>
  <p>Among those held are former commanders, logistical coordinators, and members of sleeper cells that have been linked to recent bombings in northern Syria. Authorities say the detainees have been subject to intense interrogation and continuous surveillance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Official Statements</h4>
  <p>Speaking to the BBC, Major General Rayan al‑Khaled emphasized that “the threat is evolving.” He added that the prison’s security protocols have been tightened in response to new intelligence indicating increased recruitment efforts by IS factions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Rising Threat</h4>
  <p>Recent attacks in Aleppo and Idlib have been attributed to IS remnants, with authorities warning that the group is employing guerrilla tactics and leveraging local grievances. Analysts suggest that the prison’s containment strategy is critical to preventing further escalation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>International Response</h4>
  <p>The United Nations has called for a coordinated effort to dismantle IS infrastructure, while neighboring countries have increased border patrols. Human rights organizations, however, have urged that detainees be treated in accordance with international law.</p>
