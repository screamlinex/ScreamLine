                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Inside a high‑security facility in northern Syria, Kurdish counter‑terrorism officials are reporting that Islamic State cells are regrouping and mounting more frequent attacks, raising concerns about a resurgence of extremist activity in the region.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Jail Inside</h4>
  <p>Visitors to the fortified compound in Raqqa’s outskirts find a stark, austere environment: reinforced concrete walls, a single guarded gate, and a network of underground cells designed to hold the most dangerous IS suspects. The facility’s design reflects the escalating threat, with biometric scanners, 24‑hour CCTV coverage, and a dedicated rapid‑response unit ready to intercept any breach.</p>
  <p>Inside, detainees are kept in isolated cells to prevent communication. Yet, intelligence reports indicate that some inmates have managed to establish covert networks, exchanging coded messages via handwritten notes smuggled in food parcels.</p>

  <h4>Rising Threats</h4>
  <p>“We are seeing a clear pattern of regrouping,” says Major General Ebrahim Al‑Hassan of the Kurdish Peshmerga’s counter‑terrorism wing. “In the past month, IS operatives have launched at least five coordinated attacks on civilian targets and local militia bases.”</p>
  <p>These incidents, ranging from roadside bombs to targeted shootings, have prompted a surge in patrols and a tightening of security protocols in the surrounding countryside.</p>

  <h4>Kurdish Counter‑Terrorism</h4>
  <p>The Kurdish forces, operating under the umbrella of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, have intensified their intelligence‑gathering efforts. Drone surveillance, human‑source infiltration, and cyber‑operations are now standard tools in tracking IS movements.</p>
  <p>“Our goal is to dismantle the cells before they can act,” explains Colonel Nuri Yılmaz. “We’ve already intercepted a planned attack on a village in the Jazira region, thanks to real‑time data feeds from our drones.”</p>

<section>
  <h4>International Response</h4>
  <p>Western allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have pledged additional training and equipment to bolster Kurdish security forces. Meanwhile, the United Nations has called for a coordinated regional approach to counterterrorism, emphasizing the importance of intelligence sharing and community resilience programs.</p>
  <p>Despite these efforts, experts warn that the IS network’s adaptability means that any crackdown will be met with new tactics. “It’s a cat‑and‑mouse game,” notes Dr. Leila Mansour, a counter‑terrorism analyst at the Middle East Institute. “We must stay ahead of them if we’re to keep the region stable.”</p>
