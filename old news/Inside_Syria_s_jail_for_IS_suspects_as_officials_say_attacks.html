                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Inside a remote Kurdish-run detention centre in northern Syria, officials reveal that the Islamic State (IS) is re‑organising and mounting a new wave of attacks, prompting a crackdown on suspects and a reassessment of security protocols.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Jail's Inner Sanctum</h4>
  <p>The facility, situated on a barren plateau near the Turkish border, is a sprawling complex of concrete cells and reinforced barracks. Designed to withstand both internal unrest and external raids, the centre is surrounded by a 10‑metre wall and a network of watchtowers equipped with motion‑detecting cameras. Inside, inmates are housed in cramped, ventilated cells that measure roughly 2.5 by 2.5 metres, with no windows and a single slab of steel door that can be sealed for hours on end.</p>
  <p>Despite the austere conditions, the authorities have installed a basic medical wing, a small library of banned literature, and a makeshift workshop where detainees can work on simple mechanical projects—an effort to keep them occupied and reduce the risk of mutinies.</p>

  <h4>Interrogation and Rehabilitation</h4>
  <p>Suspects are initially taken to a “neutral zone” where they are subjected to a battery of psychological and forensic examinations. Interrogators, many of whom are former Kurdish Special Forces, use a combination of structured questioning and, in some cases, what critics describe as “enhanced” interrogation techniques. The goal, officials say, is to dismantle IS cells by extracting actionable intelligence on training camps, recruitment networks, and planned attacks.</p>
  <p>After the interrogation phase, detainees enter a rehabilitation program that includes language lessons, basic education, and, for those deemed low‑risk, supervised work assignments. The programme is intended to reduce recidivism and to create a pipeline for former militants to reintegrate into Kurdish society.</p>

  <h4>Official Statements</h4>
  <p>“We are witnessing a clear resurgence of IS activity in the region,” said Major General Elî Şêwirmend, head of the Kurdish Counter‑Terrorism Unit, in an interview with the BBC. “Our intelligence indicates that cells are regrouping, training new recruits, and coordinating attacks that threaten not only Kurdish forces but also civilian populations.”</p>
  <p>Şêwirmend added that the detention centre’s expanded capacity—now able to hold over 1,200 inmates—has been
