                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> King Abdullah of Jordan told the BBC that international forces would likely be reluctant to enforce a ceasefire in Gaza until a genuine peace agreement is in place, highlighting the challenges of external intervention in the conflict.</p>

<section>
  <h4>King’s Statement</h4>
  <p>In a candid interview with the BBC, King Abdullah emphasized that “international troops will not want to enforce a Gaza peace until a real and lasting agreement exists.” He pointed out that forces deployed abroad often lack local legitimacy and can become targets of anti‑foreign sentiment, which could undermine their mission and endanger their personnel.</p>
  <p>“The people of Gaza and the wider Arab world have a right to self‑determination,” he said. “If we bring in foreign troops without a solid political framework, we risk turning the situation into another occupation.”</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Context of the Conflict</h4>
  <p>The Israeli‑Palestinian conflict has intensified in recent weeks, with escalating hostilities in Gaza and mounting casualties on both sides. Jordan, which shares a long border with the West Bank, has historically played a mediating role but has also faced domestic pressure to respond to the crisis.</p>
  <p>King Abdullah noted that the international community has called for a ceasefire, yet the lack of a unified strategy means that any peacekeeping mission would face logistical and political hurdles.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>International Response</h4>
  <p>Western nations and the United Nations have repeatedly urged for a negotiated settlement and have floated the idea of a multinational peacekeeping force. However, several countries have expressed doubts about the feasibility of such a deployment in the absence of a clear ceasefire agreement.</p>
  <p>“We cannot force peace by sending troops,” said a senior UN official. “We must first create the conditions for dialogue.” This sentiment echoes the King’s warning about the limited willingness of external actors to intervene without a solid political foundation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Implications for Peace Talks</h4>
  <p>King Abdullah’s remarks suggest that any future peace process will need to prioritize diplomatic solutions over military enforcement. He urged Arab states to coordinate a unified stance and to support initiatives that bring both sides to the negotiating table.</p>
  <p>“The world will be watching,” he added. “The credibility of the peace process will depend on whether it is built on mutual consent rather than on the presence of foreign troops.” This perspective could reshape how international actors approach the Gaza crisis, placing greater emphasis on political engagement rather than military intervention.</p>
