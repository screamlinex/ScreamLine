                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> In a swift move, President Trump announced a 10% tariff increase on Canadian goods, citing the airing of a “hostile” Reagan-era advertisement as the catalyst. The new duty will be added on top of existing levies, intensifying trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Background: The Controversial Advert</h4>
  <p>Earlier this month, a nostalgic advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan was broadcast across several U.S. television networks. The ad, promoting a political campaign, included a segment that portrayed Canada as an economic competitor. Canadian officials described the content as “unfairly negative” and “hostile.”</p>
  <p>The broadcast sparked diplomatic protests, with Ottawa urging Washington to reconsider the ad’s distribution. The incident quickly escalated as trade negotiations were already on shaky ground over agricultural and automotive tariffs.</p>

  <h4>Trump’s Statement on the Tariff Increase</h4>
  <p>“The airing of that ad was a blatant attack on our shared values and economic partnership,” Trump said in a brief statement released through the White House press office. “We will not tolerate hostile propaganda aimed at our allies, and as a result, we are imposing an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods.”</p>
  <p>Trump added that the new duty would be applied to a broad range of products, including dairy, lumber, and automotive components, and that it would take effect immediately. He warned that the administration would monitor Canada’s response closely.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Canadian Response and Diplomatic Fallout</h4>
  <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the tariff hike as “unprecedented and unjustified.” In a statement, he called on the U.S. to “respect the principles of free trade and mutual respect.” The Canadian government has indicated it will seek recourse through the World Trade Organization.</p>
  <p>Trade experts warn that the new tariffs could disrupt supply chains and increase costs for both U.S. consumers and Canadian exporters. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has urged businesses to prepare for potential disruptions.</p>

  <h4>Market Impact and Industry Reactions</h4>
  <p>Financial markets reacted sharply, with the Canadian dollar falling 1.2% against the U.S. dollar in early trading. Analysts predict a temporary spike in prices for Canadian dairy products in the U.S. market, as importers look for alternative suppliers.</p>
  <p>Automotive manufacturers have expressed concern that the tariff hike could delay production timelines for vehicles that rely on Canadian-sourced parts. Some companies are already exploring diversification strategies to mitigate the impact.</p>
