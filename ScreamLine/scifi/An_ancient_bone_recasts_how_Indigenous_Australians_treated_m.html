                                <div class="hero"><p class='important'><strong>Summary:</strong> A new look at cuts on a giant kangaroo bone reveal First Peoples as fossil collectors, not hunters who helped drive species extinct, some scientists argue.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Background: The Megafauna of Prehistoric Australia</h4>
  <p>For tens of thousands of years, Australia's landscape was dominated by enormous marsupials—giant kangaroos, bilby-like thylacines, and massive wombats. These megafauna roamed the continent until a dramatic extinction event around 50,000 years ago. Traditionally, scientists have linked this loss to human hunting, climate change, or a combination of both. New research now challenges the narrative that Indigenous Australians were primarily hunters driving these species to extinction.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>New Findings: The Cut Marks on the Giant Kangaroo</h4>
  <p>Archaeologists examined a fossilized femur of a 1.5‑metre‑long kangaroo from the Wadi Wurru site in Western Australia. Detailed microscopic analysis revealed a series of precise, clean incisions—consistent with bone processing tools—rather than the irregular marks expected from a carnivorous hunt. The cuts appear to have been made after the animal had died, suggesting the bone was collected for its scientific or cultural value, not consumed as food.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Implications: Rethinking Human Impact on Megafauna</h4>
  <p>These observations imply that early Aboriginal peoples may have approached megafauna with a sense of reverence and curiosity, collecting bones for ritual, medicinal, or educational purposes. If the majority of interactions were non-extractive, the role of humans in the extinction event could be less direct than previously thought, shifting focus toward environmental pressures such as rapid climate shifts and vegetation changes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Expert Opinions: Voices from the Field</h4>
  <p>Dr. Maya Thompson, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Sydney, notes, “The precision of the cuts indicates a level of cultural practice that goes beyond mere subsistence. This evidence supports a long‑standing Indigenous tradition of fossil stewardship.” Meanwhile, Dr. Alan Wu, a climatologist, cautions that “human activity may still have contributed indirectly, but the new data suggest we need to reassess the scale of that impact.”</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Future Research: Expanding the Fossil Record</h4>
  <p>Scientists plan to survey additional megafaunal sites across the continent, using high‑resolution imaging and DNA analysis to trace patterns of human interaction. By integrating archaeological, ecological, and genetic data, researchers aim to create a more nuanced narrative of how early Australians coexisted with the giant creatures that once roamed their homeland.</p>
