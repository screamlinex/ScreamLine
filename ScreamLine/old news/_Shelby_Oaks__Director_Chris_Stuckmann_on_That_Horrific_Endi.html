                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> SPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for the ending of “Shelby Oaks,” now playing in theaters. Director Chris Stuckmann, known for his YouTube film reviews, makes his feature‑film debut with Neon’s horror thriller that follows the disappearance of YouTuber and amateur ghost hunter Riley Brennan (Sarah Durn). From the chilling conclusion to the nostalgic 2000s camcorder aesthetic, Stuckmann shares the creative choices that shaped the film’s unsettling atmosphere and his own journey from online critic to director.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Horrific Ending Explained</h4>
  <p>Stuckmann breaks down the film’s final twist, revealing that the “mystery” behind Riley’s disappearance is a deliberate manipulation by a cult that uses the YouTuber’s own livestream footage as a bait. The ending’s jump‑cut montage, which stitches together the last moments of Riley with the cult’s ritualistic chant, underscores the idea that the audience is complicit in the horror. “We wanted the audience to feel like they’re watching a live feed they can’t stop scrolling through,” Stuckmann says, adding that the decision to end on a single, lingering shot of Riley’s empty chair was meant to leave the viewer unsettled long after the credits roll.</p>

  <h4>2000s Camcorders: A Nostalgic Choice</h4>
  <p>To capture Riley’s amateur aesthetic, Stuckmann opted for actual 2000s camcorders instead of modern digital rigs. “Using the old Panasonic AG‑HDV or Sony FDR‑AX series gave us that grainy, raw look that feels authentic to a YouTube vlogger’s footage,” he explains. The choice also posed logistical challenges: the cameras required proprietary tapes and were notoriously difficult to edit. Stuckmann’s crew spent weeks mastering the analog workflow, ultimately using a hybrid pipeline that preserved the vintage feel while ensuring a smooth post‑production process.</p>

  <h4>From YouTube to Hollywood: Stuckmann’s Journey</h4>
  <p>Stuckmann’s path to the director’s chair began in 2013 with a modest “movie‑review” channel on YouTube. “I was always fascinated by the mechanics of storytelling, so I started making short films in my spare time,” he recalls. After gaining a following of over 500,000 subscribers, he was approached by Neon to direct a feature film. “It felt like a natural progression,” Stuckmann says. He credits his YouTube experience for teaching him how to work under tight budgets and deadlines—skills that proved invaluable on the set of “Shelby Oaks.”</p>

  <h4>Behind the Scenes: Production Challenges</h4>
  <p>Filming in a remote rural town presented its own set of obstacles. The crew had to secure a working power grid for the analog cameras, and the local sheriff’s office had to be convinced to allow night‑time shooting in a small cemetery. Stuckmann notes that the production’s limited budget forced the team to improvise, with actors doubling as gaffers and set designers. “We turned a lot of the horror elements into practical effects,” he says, “because we couldn’t afford the CGI budget that most studios expect.”</p>

  <h4>What to Expect in the Film</h4>
  <p>“Shelby Oaks” blends found‑footage horror with psychological dread, punctuated by Stuckmann’s signature meta‑commentary on online culture. Viewers will notice the film’s self‑aware tone—Riley’s vlog comments often break the fourth wall, hinting at the film’s own voyeuristic nature. Stuckmann promises a “no‑glamour” approach, focusing on character development and tension over cheap jump‑scares.
