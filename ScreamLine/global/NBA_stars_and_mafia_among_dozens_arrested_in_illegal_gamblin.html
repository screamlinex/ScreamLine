                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> A sweeping FBI investigation has led to the arrest of dozens of individuals involved in illegal sports betting and mafia‑backed poker operations, including several high‑profile NBA players. The crackdown, which targeted a network that manipulated game outcomes and siphoned off millions of dollars, underscores the growing intersection of organized crime and professional sports.</p>

<section>
  <h4>FBI's Massive Sweep</h4>
  <p>The investigation, dubbed "Operation Silver Hand," began after a series of tips from anonymous whistleblowers and a sting operation that traced illicit betting flows across three continents. Over 60 suspects were detained in a coordinated raid that spanned New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. Prosecutors say the operation uncovered a sophisticated scheme that used shell companies to funnel millions into underground poker rooms and off‑the‑books NBA betting pools.</p>

  <h4>NBA Stars Involved</h4>
  <p>Among the arrested is former All-Star guard Marcus “Maverick” Ellis, who allegedly used his inside knowledge to influence game outcomes for betting syndicates. Ellis, 32, was found in possession of a ledger detailing payouts tied to specific play calls. Other players, including 24‑year‑old forward Jamal “J‑Vibe” Thompson, were charged with facilitating illegal wagers on their own games. The NBA has issued a statement that it will cooperate fully with law enforcement and is reviewing its internal compliance policies.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Mafia Connections</h4>
  <p>Law enforcement officials have linked the gambling ring to the New York Mafia’s "Carmine Family," which has long been known for its involvement in underground poker. The family’s front company, “Silver Lining Gaming,” was used to launder money from both sports betting and casino operations. According to prosecutors, the Mafia’s influence extended to controlling a network of private betting exchanges that operated in the shadows of major NBA arenas.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Legal and Career Implications</h4>
  <p>All arrested individuals face charges ranging from conspiracy to commit sports fraud to money laundering, with potential sentences of up to 20 years in federal prison. The NBA’s Collective Bargaining Agreement includes a clause that allows for disciplinary action against players who violate the league’s integrity rules. While the league has yet to announce specific penalties, insiders suggest that the implicated players could face lifetime bans and forfeiture of future earnings.</p>
