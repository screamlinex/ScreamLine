                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> All 40 victims and the survivors rescued after the boat sank off Tunisia were from sub‑Saharan African countries, an official said.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Incident</h4>
  <p>On the night of March 12, a small fishing vessel overloaded with migrants capsized approximately 12 km off the coast of Tunis. The boat, which had departed from the Libyan port of Zawiya, was carrying more than 80 people, including several infants and elderly passengers.</p>
  <p>Local coastguard reports indicate that the vessel began listing after a sudden wave hit it, and within minutes it broke apart. Rescue teams were dispatched by the Tunisian Navy and the International Maritime Organization, but the rapid sinking left little time for many on board to evacuate.</p>

  <h4>Victims and Survivors</h4>
  <p>Of the 80 people on board, 40 were confirmed dead, including 12 infants. The remaining 40 survivors were rescued and taken to a nearby medical facility for treatment. The survivors are largely from Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, according to the Tunisian Interior Ministry.</p>
  <p>One of the survivors, a 28‑year‑old woman from Mali, described the ordeal as “a nightmare that turned into a miracle.” She said that the crew tried to keep the boat afloat but “the water was everywhere.”</p>

<section>
  <h4>Rescue Efforts</h4>
  <p>The Tunisian Navy’s patrol vessel <em>Al‑Khaleej</em> arrived on the scene within 30 minutes of the distress signal. Coastguard divers recovered bodies from the water and from the wreckage, while medical teams attended to the wounded survivors.</p>
  <p>International NGOs, including the Red Crescent and Médecins Sans Frontières, have pledged additional support for the victims’ families and called for a review of the safety protocols for migrant vessels.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Reactions and Context</h4>
  <p>Tunisia’s Interior Minister, Abderrahim Moustafa, condemned the tragedy and urged stricter enforcement of maritime safety regulations. “We must protect those who risk their lives crossing the sea,” he said in a press briefing.</p>
  <p>Experts note that this incident is part of a broader pattern of dangerous crossings from Libya to North Africa. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has warned that the lack of safe, legal routes forces migrants to rely on perilous smuggling operations.</p>
