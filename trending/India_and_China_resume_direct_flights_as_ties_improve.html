                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> The first direct flight from New Delhi to Guangzhou landed in the Chinese capital on Monday morning, marking a significant milestone in the thawing of bilateral ties between India and China. The historic flight not only signals a new era of connectivity but also sets the stage for expanded trade, tourism, and cultural exchange between the two populous nations.</p>

<section>
  <h4>New Route Launch</h4>
  <p>Air India and China Eastern Airlines jointly inaugurated the Delhi‑Guangzhou corridor on Monday, with a 11‑hour, 1,400‑kilometre journey that now offers passengers a seamless, non‑stop option between the two capitals. The inaugural flight carried 180 passengers, including business executives, students, and families eager to explore the opportunities that the new link presents.</p>
  <p>Flight attendants highlighted the modern amenities onboard: complimentary Wi‑Fi, in‑flight entertainment featuring Bollywood and Chinese cinema, and a specially curated menu that fuses Indian and Cantonese flavors.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Economic Impact</h4>
  <p>Economists project that the new route could boost bilateral trade by up to 12% over the next five years, as easier travel will facilitate business delegations, joint ventures, and supply‑chain coordination. The route also opens a direct channel for Indian exporters of textiles, pharmaceuticals, and IT services to tap into China’s vast consumer market.</p>
  <p>In a statement, the Ministry of Commerce noted that “the new flight corridor is expected to generate an estimated 3.5 million USD in trade volume annually, creating thousands of jobs in both countries.”</p>

  <h4>Political Significance</h4>
  <p>The resumption of direct flights follows a series of diplomatic gestures, including a joint statement by the foreign ministries of India and China and a recent visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Beijing. Officials view the aviation breakthrough as a tangible sign of warming relations after years of tension over border disputes.</p>
  <p>“This flight is more than a commercial venture; it’s a symbol of mutual trust and cooperation,” said Dr. Sunil Gupta, spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Passenger Experience</h4>
  <p>Early travelers reported a smooth journey, with on‑time departure from Indira Gandhi International Airport and a comfortable arrival at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. The airlines offered a special “Cultural Exchange” package, featuring a bilingual in‑flight guide that explains key cultural etiquette for both Indian and Chinese passengers.</p>
  <p>Social media buzzed with photos of passengers sampling dim sum and masala chai side‑by‑side, underscoring the growing appetite for cross‑cultural culinary exploration.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Future Outlook</h4>
  <p>Both airlines have announced plans to increase frequency to three flights per week by the end of the year, with additional routes to other major Indian cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata on the horizon. The Indian government is also exploring partnerships with Chinese carriers to expand connectivity to other Chinese hubs like Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chengdu.</p>
  <p>Industry analysts predict that the new flight corridor could serve as a catalyst for broader regional integration, potentially paving the way for increased cooperation in technology, education, and tourism.</p>
