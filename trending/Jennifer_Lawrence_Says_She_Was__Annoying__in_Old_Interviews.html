                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Jennifer Lawrence recently confessed to The New Yorker that she often feels “annoying” in old interviews and has a deep reluctance to talk to the press when promoting new films. The Oscar‑winning star explains that the public’s rejection of her personality stems from her loss of control over her craft when she’s forced into promotional duty. She reveals a growing frustration with the relentless media cycle that she says erodes her authenticity and emotional well‑being.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The New Yorker Moment</h4>
  <p>In a candid interview with The New Yorker, Lawrence described the exhaustion that comes from repeated press obligations. “Every time I do an interview, I think, ‘I can’t do this to myself again,’” she said, echoing a sentiment she once shared with Viola Davis. She added that the constant scrutiny leaves her feeling “annoyed” and detached from the work she loves.</p>

  <h4>Past Press Encounters</h4>
  <p>Lawrence’s 15‑year career has been punctuated by high‑profile tabloid coverage, from blockbuster promotions to personal life headlines. She notes that earlier in her career she was more comfortable in front of cameras, but the accumulation of interviews has made her wary. “I lose control over my craft when I have to do press for a movie,” she said, highlighting the tension between public expectations and artistic integrity.</p>

  <h4>Public Rejection and Perception</h4>
  <p>Lawrence believes that the audience’s rejection of her persona is tied to the “over‑exposure” and perceived insincerity that can come from constant media appearances. She feels that the press often frames her in a one‑dimensional way, leading to a disconnect between the star she is and the image the public sees.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Future Strategy</h4>
  <p>Looking ahead, Lawrence is exploring more selective promotional tactics. She plans to limit her interview commitments to projects she feels deeply connected to, hoping to preserve her authenticity and maintain the emotional bandwidth needed for her performances. The actress remains committed to her craft, even as she navigates the evolving landscape of celebrity media engagement.</p>
