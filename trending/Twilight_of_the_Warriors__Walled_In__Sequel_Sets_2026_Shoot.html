                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> The highly anticipated sequel to Hong Kong period action film “Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In” is slated to begin shooting in March 2026, according to director Soi Cheang, who revealed the news during a Q&A session at the Tokyo International Film Festival. Cheang also teased that a prequel will be shot immediately afterward, hinting at an ambitious, multi‑chapter saga.</p>

<h4>Director’s Vision</h4>
<p>Soi Cheang emphasized that the new chapter will build on the gritty realism that made the first film a cult hit, while pushing the envelope with more elaborate set pieces and a deeper exploration of the warrior culture that shaped the region. “We’re taking the world of the original and expanding it,” he told reporters. “The next film will be darker, more personal, and, most importantly, visually richer.”</p>
