                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> 91‑year‑old Nigerian Nobel laureate in literature, Wole Soyinka, has announced that the United States has revoked his visa, citing his outspoken criticism of former President Trump’s immigration policies. The move has sparked international debate over freedom of speech, diplomatic immunity, and the treatment of aging cultural icons abroad.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Background: A Lifetime of Advocacy</h4>
  <p>Wole Soyinka, a towering figure in world literature and a former political prisoner, has long used his platform to challenge injustices—especially those related to colonialism, authoritarianism, and immigration. Over the past decade, he has publicly condemned the U.S. administration’s “zero‑tolerance” policy that led to the separation of families at the southern border.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
  <p>According to Soyinka’s spokesperson, the U.S. State Department notified the writer that his visa had been cancelled following a review of his recent public statements. Soyinka maintains that the revocation was a direct retaliation for his criticism of Trump’s border wall and “draconian” immigration laws. No formal reasons have been provided by the U.S. authorities, leading to speculation that the action may be politically motivated.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>International Response</h4>
  <p>The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement condemning what it called a “dangerous precedent” that threatens the rights of artists and dissidents worldwide. Meanwhile, the Nigerian government has urged the U.S. to reverse the decision and called the revocation “unwarranted and disrespectful.”</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Implications for Cultural Diplomacy</h4>
  <p>Experts warn that revoking visas for prominent cultural figures could chill artistic exchanges and undermine the soft power that nations rely on to promote their values abroad. As Soyinka’s case unfolds, diplomats and cultural organizations are calling for clearer guidelines to protect the mobility of artists who speak out against human rights abuses.</p>
