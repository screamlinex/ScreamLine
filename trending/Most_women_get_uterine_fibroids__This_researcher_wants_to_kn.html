                                <div class="hero"><p class='important'><strong>Summary:</strong> Biomedical engineer Erika Moore is probing the mystery behind the high incidence of uterine fibroids among women of color, seeking to uncover biological, environmental, and socioeconomic factors that drive this disparity.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Why Uterine Fibroids Matter</h4>
  <p>Uterine fibroids—benign tumors of the uterine muscle—affect up to 70% of women by age 50. While many experience mild symptoms, the condition can cause heavy bleeding, infertility, and chronic pain. Women of color, especially Black and Hispanic communities, face a two‑to‑threefold higher risk, often diagnosed at a younger age and with more aggressive disease.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Meet Erika Moore</h4>
  <p>Erika Moore, a biomedical engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana‑Champaign, combines materials science, imaging, and data analytics to study how fibroids grow and respond to therapy. Growing up in a predominantly Black neighborhood, she witnessed the toll of untreated fibroids on her family and was motivated to bridge the gap between engineering and women's health.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Engineering the Answer</h4>
  <p>Moore’s team uses high‑resolution MRI and machine‑learning algorithms to map fibroid composition and vascularity. They then fabricate biomimetic scaffolds that mimic the uterine microenvironment, allowing them to test how hormones, inflammatory signals, and genetic variants influence fibroid development. By integrating patient‑derived data with engineered models, the researchers aim to identify biomarkers that predict aggressive growth and treatment resistance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>From Bench to Bedside</h4>
  <p>Preliminary findings suggest that fibroids in women of color exhibit distinct collagen signatures and higher levels of pro‑inflammatory cytokines, pointing to a potential link between chronic stress and tumor biology. Moore is collaborating with community health centers to validate these biomarkers in diverse populations and to design targeted, non‑invasive therapies. Her goal is to reduce diagnostic delays, improve treatment efficacy, and ultimately eliminate the health disparities that keep uterine fibroids a silent crisis for millions of women.</p>
