                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> A Spanish director is bringing a distinctly Japanese story to the screen with “Konbini,” a humanistic drama about an elderly man who deliberately shoplifts to get arrested and the convenience store worker who derails his plan. Selected for the Tokyo Gap‑Financing Market, the project follows Kisayo, a struggling sound artist working night shifts, as she navigates a cross‑cultural narrative that promises both heartfelt comedy and sharp social commentary.</p>

  <h4>Film Overview</h4>
  <p>“Konbini” follows 78‑year‑old Yuki, who uses a shoplifting stunt to force a prison sentence that he believes will give him a chance to write his memoirs. His plan unravels when Aya, a young convenience store clerk, recognizes his motive and decides to help him find a different path. Set in the neon‑lit backstreets of Tokyo, the film blends humor with poignant moments about aging, redemption, and the power of small acts of kindness.</p>

  <h4>Director’s Vision</h4>
  <p>Spanish filmmaker Marco Lázaro, known for his introspective character studies, chose Japan for its unique blend of tradition and modernity. “I was drawn to the idea of an elderly protagonist confronting contemporary societal pressures,” Lázaro says. “Japan’s convenience stores are a microcosm of everyday life, making them the perfect backdrop for exploring universal themes of dignity and community.”</p>

  <h4>Tokyo Gap‑Financing Market Impact</h4>
  <p>Being selected for the Tokyo Gap‑Financing Market is a major milestone, giving the film access to local investors, distribution partners, and the broader Asian market. The market’s focus on bridging gaps between European and Asian cinema has positioned “Konbini” as a standout project that can attract both festival programmers and mainstream audiences.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Cultural Bridge</h4>
  <p>The screenplay interweaves Spanish and Japanese sensibilities—dialogue in both languages, musical motifs that blend flamenco rhythms with Japanese ambient sounds, and a narrative structure that mirrors the cyclical nature of traditional Japanese storytelling. This cultural hybridity not only enriches the film’s texture but also underscores its message of global empathy.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>Post‑market, the production will secure financing to begin principal photography in early 2026, followed by a limited theatrical release in Japan and a festival run across Europe. The team is already in talks with distributors for a potential streaming partnership to reach a worldwide audience, positioning “Konbini” as a cross‑continental conversation starter.</p>
