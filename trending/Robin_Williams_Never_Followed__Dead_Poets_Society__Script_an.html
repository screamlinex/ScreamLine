                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> In a candid Vanity Fair retrospective, Ethan Hawke reflects on his first encounter with Robin Williams on the set of *Dead Poets Society* in 1989. At 18, Hawke was struck by the actor’s fearless improvisation and his refusal to stick to the script, explaining that Williams simply did what felt right for the moment—an approach that left a lasting impression on the young actor and shaped his own career.</p>

<h4>Hawke’s First Glimpse of a Legend</h4>
<p>“I was 18, sitting in the back row of the studio, watching Robin take the stage,” Hawke recalled. “He wasn’t just performing; he was creating. He’d look at the script, and then he’d look at the audience and decide what to do next.” The interviewee described the moment as a pivotal learning experience, one that taught him the value of presence and spontaneity in film.</p>

<h4>Robin Williams’ Unscripted Philosophy</h4>
<p>Williams famously never followed the script to the letter. “He never asked for permission to throw a line away,” Hawke said, emphasizing that the actor’s instincts guided him. “If he had an idea, he just did it. He didn’t wait for the director’s nod.” This approach, Hawke noted, created a sense of authenticity that resonated with audiences and added depth to the film’s themes of individuality and freedom.</p>

<h4>Directing a Dynamic Performer</h4>
<p>Hawke highlighted the challenges the director faced: “Directing Robin was not an easy thing to do.” The director had to balance the actor’s energy with the film’s narrative structure, a task that required flexibility and trust. Hawke’s reflection on this dynamic underscores the collaborative tension that can elevate a film beyond its script.</p>

<h4>Legacy of Improvisation</h4>
<p>Years later, Hawke sees the influence of Williams’ improvisational style in his own work. “I learned early on that a character can evolve in front of the camera,” he said. “That lesson has guided my choices in acting and directing.” The interview concludes with Hawke expressing gratitude for the early exposure to a master of his craft, noting that it helped shape his artistic ethos.</p>
