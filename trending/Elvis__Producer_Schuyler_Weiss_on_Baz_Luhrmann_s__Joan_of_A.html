  <h4>Bringing Baz Luhrmann’s “Joan of Arc” to Life</h4>
  <p>When Weiss joined Baz Luhrmann on the ambitious “Joan of Arc” project, he faced the challenge of marrying Luhrmann’s flamboyant visual style with a historically grounded narrative. Weiss described the process as a “tightrope walk” between art and commerce, noting that he had to negotiate with distributors who were wary of a period piece that could be perceived as niche. He highlighted the importance of early audience testing, securing a strong marketing partner, and maintaining a clear vision that resonated with both critics and mainstream viewers.</p>

  <h4>Karaoke, Jackman, and Hollywood Culture</h4>
  <p>In a lighter moment, Weiss recalled an impromptu karaoke session with Hugh Jackman during a break in the festival. The pair traded off songs from their own filmographies—Jackman belting “You’re So Vain” while Weiss improvised a rendition of “I’ll Be There.” According to Weiss, moments like these are essential for building trust on set, reminding everyone that behind the high‑stakes production lies a community of artists who enjoy each other’s company. The anecdote became a favorite talking point, illustrating that even in the world of blockbusters, camaraderie remains a cornerstone of success.</p>
