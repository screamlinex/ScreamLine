                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Famke Janssen, who famously portrayed Jean Grey in the 2000 film X‑Men, has confirmed that Marvel has never approached her about reprising the role. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, she noted that the character is a recurring topic in every interview, yet the studio has no plans to bring her back.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Janssen on Her X‑Men Experience</h4>
  <p>Famke Janssen reflected on her time on set, describing the thrill of stepping into one of comic book lore’s most iconic characters. “It was a unique opportunity to play a character that has resonated with fans for decades,” she said. “The energy on set was electric, and working with a talented cast made the experience unforgettable.”</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Marvel‑Fox Divide</h4>
  <p>Janssen explained that the rights to the X‑Men franchise have historically been tied to Fox, and only after Disney’s acquisition did Marvel gain full control. “When Disney took over Fox, it opened the door for Marvel to reimagine the X‑Men universe,” she noted. “But even with that shift, I’ve never received a formal invitation to return.”</p>

<section>
  <h4>Every Interview Brings Up Jean Grey</h4>
  <p>Despite the lack of official offers, Janssen remarked that the character is a recurring topic whenever she’s interviewed. “Every time I’m on the record, the question about Jean Grey pops up,” she said. “It’s almost become a running joke, but it also shows how deeply connected fans are to that portrayal.”</p>

<section>
  <h4>Future Prospects for the Role</h4>
  <p>While Janssen has no plans to reprise Jean Grey, she expressed openness to future projects that might allow her to explore other facets of the X‑Men legacy. “I love the X‑Men world, but I’m also excited to bring new stories to life,” she said. “If the opportunity arises to explore a different character or storyline, I would consider it.”</p>
