                                <div class="hero"><p class='important'><strong>Summary:</strong> Hurricane Melissa has intensified into a powerful, slow‑moving storm, threatening Jamaica with heavy rainfall, destructive winds, and potentially catastrophic storm surge as it continues its track across the western Caribbean.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Formation and Rapid Intensification</h4>
  <p>Originating from a tropical wave that crossed the Atlantic in early October, Melissa entered the Caribbean on Sunday, where warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear allowed it to strengthen from a Category 1 to a Category 4 hurricane in less than 48 hours. Satellite imagery shows an eye less than 30 miles wide, indicating the system is a well‑organized, mature storm.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Storm Surge and Flood Threats for Jamaica</h4>
  <p>Jamaica’s northern coast—particularly the parishes of Clarendon, St. Catherine, and St. Andrew—faces the highest risk of storm surge. Forecast models project up to 8–10 feet of surge, which could inundate coastal communities, damage critical infrastructure, and force mass evacuations. Heavy rainfall totals of 12–18 inches are expected, raising concerns about flash flooding and landslides in the island’s hilly interior.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Preparedness and Response Measures</h4>
  <p>The Ministry of Meteorology and the Jamaica Disaster Management Agency have issued a “Category 3” alert, urging residents to secure property, stock essential supplies, and heed evacuation orders. Emergency shelters are open in designated coastal towns, and the Coast Guard has deployed additional vessels to assist with potential rescues.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Climate Change and the Rise of Super‑Storms</h4>
  <p>Scientists note that rising ocean temperatures—an effect of global warming—fuel the development of larger, longer‑lived hurricanes. In the past decade, the Atlantic has seen an uptick in storms that maintain or increase intensity after landfall, a pattern that underscores the urgency of climate adaptation strategies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Future Outlook and Monitoring</h4>
  <p>Melissa is projected to maintain Category 4 strength as it passes over Jamaica late Thursday, then move westward toward the Central American coast. The National Hurricane Center will continue to monitor the system’s trajectory and update advisories every six hours. Residents and authorities are urged to stay informed via official channels and prepare for rapid changes in conditions.</p>
