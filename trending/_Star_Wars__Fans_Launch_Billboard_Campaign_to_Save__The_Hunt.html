                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> A passionate Star Wars fanbase has launched a high‑profile billboard campaign in New York City to urge Disney to revive the shelved project “The Hunt for Ben Solo.” The billboard, featuring a bold “Save The Hunt for Ben Solo” message, follows a wave of fan‑made activism, including a paid plane banner, that has reignited debate over the future of the franchise’s next chapter.</p>

  <h4>Billboard Blitz: A New York Statement</h4>
  <p>On Tuesday, a towering billboard appeared on the side of the 55th Street and Lexington Avenue intersection, a prime spot in Midtown Manhattan. The 30‑by‑50‑foot display reads in stark white letters: “Save The Hunt for Ben Solo.” The campaign was organized by the fan group <em>BenSoloSave</em>, which also arranged a temporary “banner in the sky” by hiring a small aircraft to fly the same slogan over the city’s skyline.</p>
  <p>According to the group’s spokesperson, the billboard is part of a broader strategy to put the project “back on the public radar.” “We want Disney to see that there’s a dedicated, engaged audience ready to support the next chapter of the Skywalker saga,” she said.</p>

  <h4>The Project That Was Never Made</h4>
  <p>In 2021, Disney announced that it had shelved the planned film “The Hunt for Ben Solo,” a spin‑off that would explore the aftermath of the climactic battle in <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>. The decision left many fans disappointed, as the story promised to fill gaps in the narrative and deepen the character arc of Ben Solo, also known as Kylo Ren.</p>
  <p>Industry insiders say the cancellation was partly due to shifting studio priorities and the need to focus on the broader <em>Star Wars</em> reboot slate. However, the project’s brief existence in development has kept it alive in fan discussions, and the recent billboard campaign is a testament to that enduring interest.</p>

  <h4>Fan Mobilization and Social Media Storm</h4>
  <p>The billboard’s debut was met with an outpouring of support on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok. Hashtags such as #SaveTheHunt and #BenSoloBack surged, with fans sharing photos of the billboard and the plane banner. Some creators even produced short videos reenacting scenes from the proposed film, further fueling the conversation.</p>
  <p>“It’s amazing to see the community come together and take action,” noted a fan who prefers to remain anonymous. “We’re not just shouting into the void; we’re making a visual statement that the story matters.”</p>

  <h4>Disney’s Response and the Road Ahead</h4>
  <p>Disney has yet to issue an official statement regarding the Billboard or the fan campaign. In a brief response to a press inquiry, the company’s spokesperson said, “We appreciate the passion of our fans and are constantly evaluating how best to serve the Star Wars legacy.” No comment was made about reviving the project.</p>
  <p>Industry analysts suggest that the billboard could influence Disney’s decision-making by highlighting sustained fan interest. Whether it will be enough to resurrect “The Hunt for Ben Solo” remains to be seen, but the campaign has undeniably placed the shelved project back into the spotlight.</p>
