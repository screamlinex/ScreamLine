                                <div class="hero"><p class='important'><strong>Summary:</strong> A heated dispute over the future of the space shuttle *Discovery* has intensified as Texas senators enlist the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a legal clash with the Smithsonian Institution, raising questions about ownership, preservation, and federal oversight of national heritage artifacts.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>The *Discovery*, the most flown shuttle of NASA’s fleet, was retired in 2011 and subsequently transferred to the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian has maintained the spacecraft as a centerpiece of its permanent exhibition, while Texas senators argue that the shuttle should be returned to the state for display and educational purposes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Senators' Argument</h4>
  <p>Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz have repeatedly requested that the federal government relinquish control of *Discovery* to Texas, citing the state's investment in the shuttle’s early development and a desire to boost tourism. They contend that the Smithsonian’s stewardship has been costly and that the shuttle’s legacy is more appropriately celebrated in the state where it was assembled.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>DOJ Involvement</h4>
  <p>In a surprising move, the senators have petitioned the DOJ to intervene, arguing that the federal agency’s refusal to transfer the shuttle violates state rights and federal law. The DOJ has yet to issue a formal response, but its potential involvement could trigger a federal lawsuit that would bring the matter before the courts.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Smithsonian's Stance</h4>
  <p>The Smithsonian maintains that *Discovery* remains a national treasure, protected under the National Historic Preservation Act. Officials emphasize that the museum’s conservation efforts preserve the shuttle’s historical integrity and that any transfer could jeopardize its condition and public accessibility.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Potential Outcomes</h4>
  <p>Should the DOJ act, a legal battle could ensue over federal property rights and the jurisdiction of the Smithsonian. Possible resolutions include a negotiated transfer, a federal court ruling favoring the museum, or a compromise that allows joint stewardship. The outcome will likely set a precedent for how other historic artifacts are managed.</p>
