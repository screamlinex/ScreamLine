                                <div class="hero"><p class='important'><strong>Summary:</strong> Japan’s Akatsuki orbiter, the nation’s first dedicated Venus probe, has been officially declared dead after a 30‑day period of non‑response to ground commands. The spacecraft, launched in 2010, failed to reach Venus in 2015 and has since drifted in an irregular orbit, offering only sporadic scientific returns before its loss.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Mission History and Design</h4>
  <p>Akatsuki, also called the Venus Climate Orbiter, was launched aboard a H-IIA rocket in May 2010. Its goal was to study Venus’s atmospheric dynamics, cloud chemistry, and surface temperature through a suite of infrared imagers, a UV camera, and a microwave radiometer. After a decade of navigation challenges, the orbiter finally entered Venus orbit on December 7, 2015, at a highly eccentric trajectory that kept it out of view for most of the mission.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Final Attempts and Technical Breakdown</h4>
  <p>Over the past year, mission controllers monitored Akatsuki’s health and attempted routine uplink commands to adjust its attitude and maintain instrument calibration. However, a series of telemetry anomalies—most notably a failure to receive the “ACK” response after uplink attempts—suggested a loss of communication or a catastrophic failure of the spacecraft’s main computer. The mission team declared the orbiter lost on October 28, following a 30‑day period of inactivity that surpassed the spacecraft’s design tolerance for uncontacted operations.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Impact on Venus Science</h4>
  <p>Akatsuki’s data set, though limited, provided the most detailed infrared observations of Venus’s cloud tops since the 1970s. Its loss means the scientific community will miss out on crucial measurements of cloud motion, heat transport, and atmospheric chemistry that could refine climate models and help explain Venus’s runaway greenhouse effect. Researchers are now turning to Earth‑based telescopes and future missions, such as ESA’s upcoming DAVINCI+ and NASA’s VERITAS, to fill the knowledge gap.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Japan’s Space Strategy Going Forward</h4>
  <p>While Akatsuki’s demise is a setback, Japan’s planetary exploration program remains robust. The agency is already preparing a new Venus mission concept, “Venus Emissivity Mapper” (VEM), slated for launch in the late 2030s. Simultaneously, JAXA is focusing on lunar sample return and Mars sample return initiatives, leveraging lessons learned from Akatsuki’s extended orbit challenges to improve redundancy and autonomous fault‑tolerance in future spacecraft.</p>
