<section>
  <h4>The Olivine Experiment</h4>
  <p>In a series of high‑pressure, high‑temperature experiments conducted at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, researchers subjected synthetic olivine— a common planetary mantle mineral— to conditions that mimic the deep interiors of super‑Earths. Using a laser‑heated diamond anvil cell, the team compressed the mineral to over 30 GPa and heated it to 2000 K. They observed that the olivine's crystal lattice began to fracture, liberating trapped water molecules in a process known as dehydration melting. The released H<sub>2</sub>O formed a distinct, high‑pressure liquid phase that could percolate upward through the planet’s mantle.</p>

<section>
  <h4>How Water Forms Inside Planets</h4>
  <p>The dehydration of silicate minerals like olivine is a well‑known geochemical process on Earth, but its significance on larger exoplanets has only recently been quantified. As pressure and temperature rise with depth, the bonds that hold hydroxyl groups within the crystal structure break, allowing water to escape. The released molecules can either remain dissolved in molten silicates or segregate into discrete aqueous layers. In massive planets, the latter can accumulate to form extensive, planet‑wide “water mantles” that may eventually reach the surface if convective processes transport them upward.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Ocean Worlds in the Cosmos</h4>
  <p>Observations from the Kepler and TESS missions have identified dozens of exoplanets with radii between Earth and Neptune that likely harbor thick atmospheres and surface oceans. Traditional models have struggled to explain how such planets acquired enough water to cover their surfaces, especially those that formed beyond the snow line and then migrated inward. The new olivine results suggest an internal source: water generated deep in the mantle can ascend, condense, and accumulate on the surface, providing a steady supply of liquid without the need for extensive cometary bombardment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Early Earth and the Delivery of Water</h4>
  <p>Earth’s water inventory is still a subject of debate. While late‑heavy bombardment by water‑rich asteroids and comets is one hypothesis, the internal dehydration mechanism offers an alternative. If Earth’s early mantle contained water‑bearing minerals, the same high‑pressure chemistry that operates in super‑Earths could have released H<sub>2</sub>O early on, contributing to the nascent oceans. This scenario could reconcile the relatively low water content inferred from bulk silicate Earth models with the abundant surface water we observe today.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
  <p>Future work will involve coupling these laboratory findings with global circulation models to predict how water migrates from the deep mantle to a planet’s surface. Planned missions, such as the James Webb Space Telescope’s extended exoplanet survey and the upcoming Europa Clipper, will provide data on planetary atmospheres and surface compositions that can test the internal water hypothesis. On Earth, next‑generation high‑pressure apparatuses will refine the temperature and</div>
