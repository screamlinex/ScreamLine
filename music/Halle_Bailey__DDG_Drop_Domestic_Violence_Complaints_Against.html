                                <div class="hero">
                                    <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Former pop duo members Halle Bailey and DDG mutually filed domestic violence complaints against each other. Both parties subsequently reached a settlement that includes a custody arrangement for their two‑year‑old son.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>Halle Bailey, known for her role in Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” and as a rising pop artist, and DDG, a rapper and YouTuber, were in a romantic relationship from 2019 to 2022. In late 2023, both parties publicly announced that they had filed domestic violence complaints against one another, citing alleged incidents that occurred during their relationship.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Legal Proceedings</h4>
  <p>Bailey’s complaint was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that DDG had threatened and physically assaulted her. DDG’s counter‑complaint was filed in the same jurisdiction, alleging that Bailey had used a weapon and threatened his safety. Both complaints were dismissed by the court after the parties agreed to a mutual release of claims.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Settlement and Custody Arrangement</h4>
  <p>As part of a confidential settlement, Bailey and DDG agreed to a joint custody schedule for their two‑year‑old son, who was born in 2021. The arrangement grants the child a primary residence with Bailey while providing regular visitation with DDG. Both parties also agreed to a no‑contact order and a financial support agreement that covers the child’s medical, educational, and general expenses.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Current Status</h4>
  <p>Following the settlement, both Bailey and DDG have returned to their respective careers. Bailey has resumed recording new music, while DDG has continued producing content for his YouTube channel. Neither party has publicly commented on the details of their dispute beyond the agreed-upon settlement terms.</p>
