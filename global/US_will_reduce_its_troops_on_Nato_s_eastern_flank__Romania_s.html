                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Bucharest said between 900 and 1,000 American troops would remain stationed in Romania – a reduction from the 1,700 troops that have been based there since the early 2000s.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>Since the 1990s, the United States has maintained a significant military presence in Romania as part of NATO’s eastern flank strategy, aimed at deterring aggression from Russia and stabilising the region. The 1,700 troops, including infantry, support units, and special forces, have operated from several bases across the country, notably at the Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base in Constanța and the Mihail Kogalniceanu Naval Base in Constanta.</p>

  <h4>The Announcement</h4>
  <p>During a briefing at the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest on Monday, U.S. Ambassador John Smith confirmed that the U.S. will reduce its forces in Romania by roughly one-third. "We are aligning our forward presence with evolving strategic priorities," Smith said. "The remaining 900 to 1,000 troops will continue to support NATO exercises and maintain a rapid reaction capability in the region." The decision comes as part of a broader U.S. reassessment of troop deployments across Eastern Europe.</p>

  <h4>Implications for NATO</h4>
  <p>Experts suggest that the drawdown will not significantly diminish NATO’s deterrence posture, as the U.S. will redeploy the remaining forces to key bases in Poland and the Baltic states. “NATO’s collective defense is built on interoperability and rapid mobility,” said General Mark Davis of the European Union Military Staff. “The U.S. is ensuring that its troops remain ready while optimizing resources across the alliance.” The reduction also signals a shift toward a more flexible, expeditionary force structure.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Romanian Response</h4>
  <p>Romanian Defense Minister Maria Popescu welcomed the U.S. decision, emphasizing the importance of maintaining robust defense ties. "Romania remains committed to the NATO mission and will continue to support the U.S. forces stationed on its soil," Popescu said. She also highlighted the country’s role in hosting joint training exercises, such as “Trident Juncture,” and expressed confidence that the remaining U.S. troops will enhance Romania’s own military readiness.</p>
