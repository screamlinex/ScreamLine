                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Dutch voters once again head to the polls, but the political landscape has shifted dramatically. Anti‑Islam populist Geert Wilders, who secured a clear majority in the November 2023 elections, now faces a much tighter race as his party’s support dwindles and several rivals surge in the polls.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Shifting Landscape</h4>
  <p>Wilders’ People’s Party for Freedom (PVV) dominated the last election, capitalising on fears over immigration and national identity. This year, however, the party’s share of the popular vote has slipped from 20% to just over 12%, signalling a significant erosion of its base. Analysts attribute the decline to a combination of voter fatigue, increased scrutiny over Wilders’ rhetoric, and a broader appetite for more moderate policies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Key Players in the Race</h4>
  <p>Three main contenders now appear poised to challenge the PVV’s dominance. The governing VVD, led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, is eyeing a second term but must navigate a fractured coalition. The Labour Party (PvdA) is gaining momentum on social justice issues, while the progressive green party GroenLinks is riding a wave of environmental activism. A smaller but growing protest group, the Forum for Democracy (FvD), has also started to attract attention with its Euroskeptic stance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Polling Trends</h4>
  <p>Recent polls reveal a dramatic tightening of the field. The PVV sits at 12.4%, a sharp drop from the 20.3% recorded last November. The VVD follows closely at 11.8%, while Labour and GroenLinks both hover around 10-11%. The FvD, once a fringe party, now sits at 6.7%, indicating a broader appetite for radical change among a subset of voters. These numbers suggest that even a small swing could alter the composition of the Dutch parliament.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Impact on Dutch Politics</h4>
  <p>With no party able to secure an outright majority, coalition negotiations are expected to become more complex. The PVV’s potential to act as kingmaker could either be an opportunity or a liability, depending on whether it can forge alliances with the VVD or the more centrist parties. Should Wilders’ party fail to secure enough seats, the Netherlands may witness its first fully pro‑European coalition in a decade—a development that could reshape its stance on immigration, defense, and foreign policy.</p>
