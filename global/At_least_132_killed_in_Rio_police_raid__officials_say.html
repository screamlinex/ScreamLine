                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> At least 132 people lost their lives in a police raid on a criminal gang operating in Rio’s densely populated favelas, marking the deadliest operation in the city’s history. The joint effort by federal and local police targeted the group known as “Os Desmanche,” but the high casualty toll has ignited public outrage and demands for accountability.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Operation Details</h4>
  <p>The raid, conducted early Sunday morning, unfolded across three blocks in the Rocinha and Jardim Ângelo neighborhoods. Approximately 300 officers from the Federal Police, the Military Police, and the Civil Police mobilized to seize weapons caches and arrest key figures of the gang. The operation reportedly lasted over four hours, during which intense firefights erupted between police and armed members of the gang.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Reactions from Officials</h4>
  <p>Mayor Eduardo Paes called the raid a “necessary measure to restore order,” while Federal Police Chief Maria de Souza condemned the violence, stating that the operation adhered to legal protocols. The Governor of Rio de Janeiro announced a full investigation into the conduct of the forces involved and pledged support for the affected families.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Impact on the Community</h4>
  <p>Local residents reported widespread displacement as entire families lost homes to the chaos of the raid. Human rights groups have documented instances of property damage and the tragic loss of non-combatants, including children and elderly. Community leaders are demanding comprehensive support programs for those left homeless.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Legal and Ethical Concerns</h4>
  <p>Civil liberties advocates argue that the raid exceeded proportionality, citing the use of excessive force and the lack of clear evidence of armed resistance at the time of the assault. Calls are growing for an independent inquiry to examine whether the police complied with Brazilian and international standards for use of force.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>A special task force has been established to oversee a forensic investigation of the raid sites, with the goal of identifying any violations of protocol. The Federal Police have indicated that suspects will face a series of trials, while city officials plan to review and potentially reform engagement strategies with armed groups in favelas to prevent future tragedies.</p>
