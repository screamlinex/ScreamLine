                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed that the UK's first chartered flight from Jamaica to the UK, carrying evacuated Britons, is scheduled to arrive on Sunday. The flight is part of a broader aid response to Hurricane Melissa, which has devastated Jamaica’s Caribbean coast.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Evacuation Efforts</h4>
  <p>More than 1,200 British nationals were evacuated from the West Indian island in a coordinated operation involving the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, and local authorities. The operation began early this week, with evacuees first being transported to a temporary shelter in Kingston before being loaded onto the chartered flight. The flight, a Boeing 757, will depart from Sangster International Airport at 02:00 GMT and arrive in London Heathrow at 07:30 GMT.</p>

<section>
  <h4>UK Response</h4>
  <p>The UK government has pledged £15 million in emergency aid for Jamaica, which includes supplies for shelters, medical assistance, and restoration of power in affected regions. In addition to the evacuation flight, the UK’s Royal Navy has deployed a disaster relief team to the island to help with debris removal and to provide medical support to those affected by the storm.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Local Impact</h4>
  <p>Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm of the season, has left widespread damage across the island’s eastern and southern coasts. Flooding has destroyed homes, disrupted power and water supplies, and displaced thousands of residents. The British community, though a small minority, has been among those hardest hit, with several families losing their homes entirely.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Future Plans</h4>
  <p>Cooper indicated that the UK will continue to support Jamaica beyond the immediate evacuation and relief phase. Plans include a second chartered flight to bring additional aid supplies and a commitment to assist in rebuilding critical infrastructure such as schools and hospitals. The UK’s Ministry of Defence will also keep a standby response force ready in case further evacuation or humanitarian assistance becomes necessary.</p>
