                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> In a stark reminder of the fragile ceasefire, Israeli forces carried out airstrikes that killed 33 civilians in Gaza, according to the Hamas‑run civil defence. The assault follows a series of exchanges, with both sides accusing the other of violating the U.S.‑brokered truce. President Trump has publicly asserted that the ceasefire remains intact, a claim that is being challenged on the ground.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Human Toll</h4>
  <p>The latest strikes took the lives of 33 residents in densely populated neighborhoods, including children and medical staff. The Hamas civil defence reports that the casualties were predominantly civilians caught in the crossfire, a detail that has intensified calls for stricter accountability and protection of non‑combatants.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Ceasefire Status in Question</h4>
  <p>Both Israel and Hamas have issued statements accusing each other of breaching the ceasefire. While Israeli officials claim the strikes were aimed at militant targets, Hamas officials argue that the attacks were indiscriminate and a continuation of the blockade.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Trump’s Stand</h4>
  <p>President Trump has repeatedly affirmed that the ceasefire remains in force, citing diplomatic talks between Washington, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. Critics argue that his stance overlooks the escalating violence and the reported civilian casualties.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>International Reactions</h4>
  <p>The United Nations and several European nations have called for an immediate review of the ceasefire terms, urging both parties to adhere to international humanitarian law. Human rights organizations are demanding independent investigations into the reported violations.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Impact on the Entertainment Community</h4>
  <p>Hollywood has paused filming in the region, and several film festivals are postponing events that would have featured Gaza‑related documentaries. Artists worldwide are using social media to raise awareness, while some musicians have called for peace concerts to highlight the human cost of the conflict.</p>
