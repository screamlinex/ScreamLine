                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> South Korea's President Lee is in for a diplomatic dance as he hosts the leaders of the US and China, balancing economic ties, security concerns, and domestic expectations.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Diplomatic Tightrope</h4>
  <p>President Yoon Suk-yeol’s Seoul has become the stage for a high‑stakes performance, with the U.S. President and the Chinese President arriving back‑to‑back. The stakes are clear: the U.S. seeks to reinforce its alliance against North Korea and to secure a foothold in the Indo‑Pacific, while China aims to maintain its influence in the Korean Peninsula and expand trade. Lee’s task is to keep both powers satisfied without alienating either side or his own electorate.</p>

  <h4>The U.S. Visit: A Strategic Check‑In</h4>
  <p>The U.S. delegation arrived first, bringing a host of security and trade topics to the table. Discussions touched on missile defense upgrades, joint military exercises, and a possible expansion of the U.S. military presence on the island. Lee used the meeting to underscore South Korea’s role as a key partner in the U.S. “free‑and‑open” policy, while subtly reminding Washington of the importance of respecting Korean sovereignty.</p>

  <h4>The Chinese Delegation: Economic Ties and Tensions</h4>
  <p>China’s arrival followed a short pause, during which Lee highlighted the country’s commitment to the “One China” policy and its willingness to deepen economic cooperation. Trade negotiations focused on reducing tariffs, expanding joint ventures, and easing restrictions on Chinese investment in high‑tech sectors. Yet the talks were peppered with caution as Lee navigated the complex relationship between economic necessity and geopolitical rivalry.</p>

  <h4>Balancing Act: Domestic and International Implications</h4>
  <p>Domestically, Lee faces a divided public: some praise his outreach to both superpowers, while others fear that it could undermine South Korea’s autonomy. Internationally, the nation’s delicate position could influence regional stability and the future of the U.S.–China rivalry. As the diplomatic dance continues, all eyes remain on Seoul, where every handshake and policy statement carries weight far beyond its borders.</p>
