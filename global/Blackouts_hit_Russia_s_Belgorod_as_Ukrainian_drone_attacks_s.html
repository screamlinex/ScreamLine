                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> A surge in Ukrainian drone attacks has plunged Russia’s Belgorod region into widespread blackouts, prompting Russian officials to blame the strikes on a retaliatory campaign aimed at countering frequent Russian raids on Ukrainian cities.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Impact on Belgorod</h4>
  <p>Residents of Belgorod, a city only 200 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, woke up to a sudden loss of electricity as power lines were struck by a wave of low‑flying drones. Hospitals, schools, and public transportation systems were forced to switch to emergency generators, while the local government issued a city‑wide emergency alert. According to the Belgorod Energy Authority, the outages affected nearly 70% of the region’s households, with some areas remaining in darkness for up to 48 hours.</p>

  <h4>Ukrainian Drone Tactics</h4>
  <p>Ukrainian forces have increased the frequency and precision of their drone sorties over Russian territory, targeting infrastructure that supports the Russian war effort. The latest wave of attacks employed a mix of commercial quadcopters fitted with improvised explosives and more sophisticated UAVs capable of carrying small munitions. Ukrainian officials claim the strikes are a direct response to Russia’s repeated bombing campaigns against Ukrainian cities, arguing that the drone attacks are aimed at disrupting the logistical backbone of the Russian military.</p>

  <h4>Russian Defensive Measures</h4>
  <p>In response to the escalating drone threat, Russian authorities have deployed additional anti‑aircraft systems along the Belgorod border and increased patrols of critical infrastructure. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the activation of a new “Cyber‑Electronic Warfare” unit tasked with jamming drone communications and intercepting hostile UAVs before they can reach their targets. However, analysts note that the sheer volume of drones has strained Russia’s air defense capabilities, raising questions about the sustainability of their current defensive posture.</p>

  <h4>Broader Geopolitical Context</h4>
  <p>The surge in drone activity comes amid heightened tensions across the region, as both sides intensify their military campaigns. International observers warn that the escalation could spill over into neighboring countries and potentially trigger a broader regional conflict. Meanwhile, humanitarian organizations are calling for a de‑escalation of hostilities to protect civilians in both Russia and Ukraine, emphasizing the need for diplomatic engagement to prevent further civilian casualties and infrastructure damage.</p>
