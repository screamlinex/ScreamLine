                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> After the Category 4 hurricane that tore through Jamaica last week, residents in the coastal parish of Black River are reporting a dire lack of food and other essential supplies. Despite calls to aid agencies, many families say they have not seen any relief efforts, leaving them to fight for survival in the days following the storm.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Impact in Black River</h4>
  <p>The storm’s winds ripped through Black River, flooding villages and washing away homes. Roads that once connected the parish to the rest of the island were cut off, preventing emergency supplies from reaching the hardest-hit areas. Local farmers report that their crops were destroyed, leaving the community with no fresh produce.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Local residents' accounts</h4>
  <p>“We have no food at all,” says 32‑year‑old farmer Marlon Thompson, who has been living in a makeshift shelter since the hurricane. “We went to the relief centre yesterday, but there was nothing there – no water, no canned goods, no even a bag of rice.” A mother of three, Marlene, echoes the sentiment: “The food we have is stale, and we can’t afford to buy fresh.”</p>

<section>
  <h4>Aid efforts and delays</h4>
  <p>Initial relief teams from the Jamaican Red Cross and the Ministry of Local Government were dispatched within 24 hours of the landfall. However, the teams faced logistical challenges: damaged roads, collapsed bridges, and a surge of volunteers overloading the limited transport capacity. According to officials, a new convoy is expected to arrive in the next 48 hours, but many residents remain in limbo.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Government response</h4>
  <p>Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a statement urging calm and cooperation. He pledged that the government would allocate an additional $5 million in emergency food supplies and would coordinate with international partners to expedite delivery. Critics argue that the response has been slow and that local NGOs are being sidelined.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Looking ahead</h4>
  <p>Experts warn that the lack of immediate relief could lead to a public health crisis, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and children. Meanwhile, community leaders are calling on international donors to step in and provide the necessary food, water, and medical supplies to prevent the situation from worsening.</p>
