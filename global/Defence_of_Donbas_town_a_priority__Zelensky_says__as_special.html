                            <div class="hero">
                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that safeguarding the Donbas town of Pokrovsk is a top priority, announcing the deployment of elite special forces to protect the critical supply lines feeding the front. Army sources confirmed the presence of these troops on the ground, as reported by BBC military intelligence.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Zelensky’s Urgent Call</h4>
  <p>In a televised address to the nation, Zelensky highlighted Pokrovsk’s strategic significance as a gateway to the rest of Donbas. He pledged “full support” from the army and called for rapid reinforcement to counter the growing Russian pressure on the town’s perimeter.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Special Forces on the Front</h4>
  <p>Sources within the Ukrainian Armed Forces revealed that units from the 95th Special Forces Brigade have been inserted into the area. These troops, trained in rapid assault and urban warfare, are tasked with securing key positions along the supply routes that reach the 73rd Mechanized Brigade stationed in Pokrovsk.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Protecting the Lifeline</h4>
  <p>The supply lines that traverse the eastern rail corridor are the lifeline for troops and civilians alike. Intelligence reports indicate that the special forces are conducting night‑time patrols, establishing observation posts, and coordinating with engineering units to clear mines and improvised explosive devices that threaten convoy movements.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Town Under Pressure</h4>
  <p>Pokrovsk’s residents report increased patrols and heightened security measures. Local officials say that, while the town remains under Ukrainian control, the risk of a sudden offensive has risen, prompting the community to prepare for potential shortages of essential goods.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Analysts Weigh In</h4>
  <p>Defense analysts suggest that the deployment of special forces could act as a force multiplier, allowing Ukrainian troops to maintain control over the supply routes with fewer resources. However, they warn that sustained pressure from Russian armored units could still threaten the town’s stability if the supply lines are disrupted.</p>
