                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Almost a year after the fall of the Assad regime, Syrians are facing another fight – for justice and accountability.</p>

<section>
  <h4>The Quest for Accountability on the Ground</h4>
  <p>Across the shattered cities of Aleppo, Homs, and Raqqa, local communities are demanding answers to the atrocities committed during the years of conflict. Victims’ families have organized vigil gatherings, demanding that perpetrators be identified and brought to trial. In many areas, the absence of a functioning judiciary has turned the pursuit of justice into a grassroots movement, with community elders and activists stepping in to document evidence and support victims.</p>
  <p>Despite these efforts, the political vacuum left by the ouster of the regime has created a legal gray zone. Armed groups still control key territories, and their influence hampers the establishment of reliable investigative bodies. This uncertainty has left many perpetrators unpunished, deepening the sense of impunity that plagues the country.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>The Role of International Courts</h4>
  <p>In the absence of domestic mechanisms, international bodies have stepped forward. The International Criminal Court (ICC) and the United Nations Independent Commission of Inquiry have issued indictments against former officials for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Commission for the Prevention of Torture and the Syrian Center for Constitutional Rights have been working in tandem with international partners to collect admissible evidence.</p>
  <p>However, the effectiveness of these institutions is limited by diplomatic resistance, sanctions, and logistical constraints. Some states refuse to cooperate, citing sovereignty concerns, while others fear the political fallout of extraditing high-profile suspects. This complex diplomatic environment has slowed the pace of prosecutions and left many Syrians skeptical about the reach of international justice.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Civilian Voices and Grassroots Movements</h4>
  <p>Amid the institutional challenges, civil society has emerged as a powerful catalyst for change. Women’s groups, youth activists, and religious leaders have organized “Justice Walks” that trace the routes of past massacres, bringing international attention to overlooked crimes. Their persistent advocacy has pressured both national and international actors to prioritize the reconstruction of legal frameworks.</p>
  <p>Moreover, digital campaigns such as “#SyriaJustice” have leveraged social media to crowdsource testimonies and evidence, creating a living archive that could be invaluable for future trials. These grassroots initiatives highlight the resilience of Syrian citizens and their unwavering commitment to holding perpetrators accountable.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Looking Ahead: Challenges and Hope</h4>
  <p>Rebuilding Syria’s justice system will require a multi-faceted approach that balances reparations, truth-telling, and accountability. Reconciliation commissions, truth panels, and transitional justice mechanisms are being discussed in diplomatic circles, but consensus remains elusive.</p>
  <p>Despite the obstacles, there is a growing sense of cautious optimism. International donors are increasing funding for legal aid programs, and new alliances between Syrian civil society and regional partners are forming. If these efforts can be sustained, they may pave the way for a future where the memory of the past does not erase the possibility of a just, democratic Syria.</p>
