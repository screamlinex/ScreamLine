                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Dutch volleyball player Steven van de Velde, who was convicted in 2016 of raping a 12‑year‑old British girl, has had his visa application to travel to Australia for an upcoming tournament denied by authorities citing security and public safety concerns.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>Steven van de Velde, 35, has played for several professional clubs in the Dutch Eredivisie and was a key member of the national team during the 2014–2015 season. In 2016 he was sentenced to five years in prison for the sexual assault of a minor, a conviction that was later upheld on appeal. He was released on parole in 2018.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Visa application and denial</h4>
  <p>In June 2025 van de Velde submitted a visa application to attend the 2025 Oceania Volleyball Championship in Melbourne, where he would compete as a player for the Dutch national squad. The Australian Department of Home Affairs reviewed the application and, after consulting with law‑enforcement and child‑protection agencies, rejected it. The decision cited the convicted nature of the applicant’s prior offence and the potential risk it posed to the sporting event and the Australian public.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Reactions from the Dutch federation</h4>
  <p>The Dutch Volleyball Federation (KNVB) expressed disappointment with the outcome, stating that the decision “does not align with the federation’s commitment to the sport’s integrity and the safety of all participants.” They added that the federation would continue to support van de Velde’s rehabilitation efforts while ensuring that all future travel arrangements comply with international legal requirements.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Legal and policy implications</h4>
  <p>Australia’s visa policy includes provisions that bar entry to individuals with serious criminal convictions, especially those involving sexual offences. The case highlights the challenges of balancing rehabilitation with public safety, and it may prompt further discussion within sporting bodies about vetting athletes with criminal histories who wish to compete internationally.</p>
