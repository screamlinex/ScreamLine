                                <p class="important"><strong>Summary:</strong> Alassane Ouattara, 83, secured a fourth term in a presidential election that saw his main rivals barred from the ballot, leaving the outcome largely predetermined.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Election Context</h4>
  <p>The 2024 Ivory Coast presidential election was held on 6 March, following the country’s constitutional mandate to hold elections every five years. Ouattara, who has led the nation since 2010, was seeking to extend his tenure into a historic fourth term, a move that has sparked debate about the longevity of Ivory Coast’s democratic institutions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Barred Rivals</h4>
  <p>Two prominent opposition candidates—former Prime Minister Patrick Achi and charismatic activist Alassane G. Diabaté—were disqualified by the Constitutional Council in a ruling that cited alleged violations of campaign finance regulations and procedural lapses. The council’s decision was widely criticized as politically motivated, effectively removing the only credible challengers from the race.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Domestic Reactions</h4>
  <p>Protests erupted in Abidjan and other major cities, with opposition parties accusing the government of undermining democratic processes. While the police managed to quell the demonstrations, several activists were detained and a handful of journalists reported threats to their safety.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>International Reactions</h4>
  <p>The African Union and ECOWAS expressed concerns over the fairness of the election, urging a thorough review of the disqualification process. Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union praised the high voter turnout but called for reforms to ensure future elections remain credible.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
  <p>With Ouattara’s mandate secured, the Ivory Coast faces the challenge of addressing growing economic inequality and maintaining political stability. Analysts warn that the concentration of power may lead to increased civil unrest if reforms are not pursued.</p>
