  <h4>Election Results</h4>
  <p>The re-election of President John Magufuli has been confirmed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, which announced a victory margin of 62% to the opposition’s 38%.  The official tally recorded 3.2 million votes, with a turnout of 63%, the highest in the country’s recent history.  Magufuli’s party, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), secured a majority in the National Assembly, consolidating the president’s political influence.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Protests and Unrest</h4>
  <p>Despite the official results, protests erupted across several major cities, including Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, and Arusha.  Youth demonstrators, many of whom were university students, chanted slogans calling the election “rigged” and demanding a recount.  The police response was swift, deploying tear gas and rubber‑bulleted batons to disperse crowds, and several hundred people were detained during the clashes.  Reports from local media outlets indicate that at least 15 activists suffered injuries, though the exact number remains uncertain due to limited access to hospitals in the affected areas.</p>

  <h4>International Reactions</h4>
  <p>Global leaders have issued mixed statements following the election and subsequent unrest.  The African Union released a brief statement calling for a “calm and orderly review” of the electoral process, while the European Union urged all parties to respect the democratic outcome and ensure the safety of protestors.  The United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam issued a warning to American citizens in the region, advising them to exercise caution amid the ongoing demonstrations.</p>
